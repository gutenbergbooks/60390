<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">While</span> Lord Wellington detained in Portugal the
most numerous of the French armies, defied their
strength and baffled their combinations, events of great
importance, both military and civil, were taking place
in Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marshal Macdonald succeeds Augereau.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The command in Catalonia had devolved upon Camp-Marshal
Juan Manuel de Villena, during the
time that O’Donell was invalided by his wound.
He had to oppose in Marshal Macdonald a
general of higher reputation and of a better stamp than
Augereau. Augereau had passed through the revolutionary
war without obtaining any worse character than
that of rapacity; but in Catalonia he manifested a ferocious
and cruel temper, of which he had not before
been suspected. Every armed Catalan who fell alive
into his hand was sent to the gibbet: the people were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
not slow at reprisals, and war became truly dreadful
when cruelty appeared on both sides to be only the
exercise of vindictive justice: it was made so hateful to
the better part of the German soldiers, and to the
younger French also, whose hearts had not yet been
seared, that they sought eagerly for every opportunity
of fighting, in the hope of receiving wounds

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Von Staff, 296.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

which should entitle them to their dismission,
or, at the worst, of speedily terminating a life which
was rendered odious by the service wherein they were
engaged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Siege of Mequinenza.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The force under Macdonald’s command consisted of
21,000 men, including 2000 cavalry, and of
16,500 employed in garrisons and in the points
of communication; the army of Aragon also, which
Suchet commanded, was under his direction. They
could not in Catalonia, as they had done in other parts
of Spain, press forward, and leave defensible towns behind
them: it was necessary to take every place that
could be defended by a resolute people, and to secure it
when taken. After Lerida had been villanously betrayed
by Garcia Conde, Tortosa became the next point
of importance for the French to gain, for while that city
was held by the Spaniards, the communication between
Valencia and Catalonia could not be cut off. Tarragona
and Valencia were then successively to be attacked, but
Mequinenza was to be taken before Tortosa was besieged.
This town, which was called Octogesa when the Romans
became masters of Spain, which by the corrupted name
of Ictosa was the seat of a bishop’s see under the Wisigoths,
and which obtained its present appellation from
the Moors, was at the present juncture a point of considerable
importance, because it commanded the navigation
of the Ebro, being situated where that river
receives the Segre. It was now a decayed town with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
fortified castle: the works never had been strong, and
since the Succession-war had received only such hasty
repairs as had been made, at the urgent representations
of General Doyle, during the second siege of Zaragoza.
These preparations had enabled it to repulse the enemy
in three several attempts after the fall of that city. It
had now, by Doyle s exertions, been well supplied with
provisions, but every thing else was wanting; the garrison
consisted of 700 men, upon whose discipline or
subordination the commander, D. Manuel Carbon, could
but ill rely. He himself was disposed to do his duty,
and was well supported by some of his officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 18.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Six days after the betrayal of Lerida the French Colonel
Robert was sent with three battalions to commence
operations against this poor fortress; he tried to
force the passage of a bridge over the Cinca, which was
so well defended, that it cost him 400 men. Between
that river and the Ebro, Mousnier’s division approached
so as to straiten the place, and a bridge of boats was
thrown across the Ebro, and a tête-du-pont constructed
to cut off the besieged from succour on that side. The
operations were conducted with little skill or success,
till at the expiration of a fortnight Colonel Rogniat came
to direct them. Carbon then found it necessary to
abandon the place, and retire into the Castle; to this he
was compelled less by the efforts of the enemy than by
distrust of his own men, who now becoming hopeless of
relief, took every opportunity of deserting. His only
armourer had fled, so had his masons, his carpenters, and
his medical staff, the latter taking with them their stores.
Four of the iron guns had burst, ... two brazen ones were
rendered useless; and the Castle, which the people
looked upon as impregnable, was not only weak in itself,
but incapable of long resistance, had it been stronger,
for want of water: there was none within the works; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
was to be brought from a distance, and by a difficult

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

road. The governor represented to the captain-general
that his situation was truly miserable;
that the best thing he could do, were it possible, would
be to bring off the remains of the garrison; but they
were between the Ebro and the Segre, and the banks of
both rivers were occupied by the enemy. A force of at
least 3000 men would be required to relieve him ...
whereas 500 might have sufficed if they had been sent
from Tortosa in time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mequinenza taken.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This dispatch was brought to Villena by a peasant
who succeeded in swimming the Segre with it;
and an attempt accordingly was made to relieve
the Castle, but it was made too late. General Doyle,
whom the Junta of Tortosa had addressed entreating him
to continue his services to Mequinenza, asked and obtained
the command of the succours, and was on the way
with them, when they were met by tidings that the garrison

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 8.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

had surrendered. The course of the Ebro
from Zaragoza was now open to the enemy, and
they prepared immediately to besiege Tortosa. If Suchet
had known the state of the city at this time, he might
have won it by a coup-de-main. The suspicions of
the people had been re-inflamed by the betrayal of
Lerida; the fall of Mequinenza excited their fears;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lili appointed to the command in Tortosa.<br /><span class="extlink">Vol. i. 731–735.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and an insurrection was apprehended, to prevent which
Villena requested Doyle to hasten thither, and act as
governor till the Conde de Alache, D. Miguel de Lili y
Idiaquez, should arrive. This nobleman had
displayed such skill and enterprise in the painful
but fortunate retreat which he made with a
handful of men after the wreck of the central
army at Tudela, that it was thought no man
could be more adequate to the important service
for which he was now chosen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tortosa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Tortosa stands upon the left bank of the Ebro, about
four leagues from the sea; it is on the high
road by which Catalonia communicates with the
south of Spain. Before the Roman conquest the Ilercaones
had their chief settlement here, and the place was
called after the tribe Ilercaonia; Dartosa was its Roman
name, which either under the Goths or Moors passed
into the present appellation. It was taken from the
Moors<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> by Louis le Debonnaire, during the life of his
father Charlemagne, after a remarkable siege, in which
all the military engines of that age seem to have been
employed. The governor whom he left there revolted,
called in the Moors to his support, and they took it for
themselves. It was conquered from them by Ramon
Berenguer, Count of Barcelona, in the middle of the
twelfth century; and in the year following was saved
from the Moors by the women, who took arms when the
men were almost overpowered, rallied them, and animated
them so that they repulsed the entering enemy:
in honour of this event a military order was instituted,
and it was enacted that the women of Tortosa should
have precedence of the men in all public ceremonies.
During that revolt of the Catalans which was one of the
many and great evils brought upon Spain by the iniquitous
administration of Olivares, Tortosa declared early
for the provincial cause; but it was reduced to obedience
soon and without violence, and the city, which then contained
2000 inhabitants, was secured against any sudden
attack. Marshal de la Mothe besieged it in 1642, and
effected a breach in its weak works: he was repulsed in
an assault with considerable loss, and deemed it necessary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
to raise the siege. Six years afterwards the French,
with Schomberg for their general, took it by storm, ...
the bishop and most of the clergy falling in the breach.
It was retaken in 1650. In the Succession-war this
place was gladly given up to the allies by the people, as
soon as the capture of Barcelona by Lord Peterborough
enabled them to declare their sentiments. The Duke of
Orleans took it in 1708 by a vigorous siege, and through
the want of firmness in the governor; had it held out
two days longer, the besieging army must have retired
for want of supplies. Staremberg almost succeeded in
recovering it by surprise a few months afterwards; and
in 1711 he failed in a second attempt. From that time the
city had flourished during nearly an hundred years of
internal peace; the population had increased to 16,000;
the chief export was potash; the chief trade in wheat,
which was either imported hither or exported hence, according
as the harvest had proved in the two provinces
of Catalonia and Aragon. But during this long interval
of tranquillity, while the city and its neighbourhood
partook the prosperity of the most industrious province
in Spain, the fortifications, like every thing upon which
the strength and security of the state depended, had
been neglected, and were falling to decay.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations for the siege of that city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This place, which could only have opposed a tumultuous
resistance if the French had immediately
pursued their success, was soon secured against
any sudden attack by Doyle’s exertions. He
had given up his pay in the Spanish service to the use
of this province, and the confidence which was placed in
him by the people and the local authorities, as well
as by the generals, gave him influence and authority
wherever he went. Every effort was made for storing and
strengthening the city, while the enemy on their part
made preparations for besieging it in form. Mequinenza<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
was their depôt for the siege: from thence the artillery
was conveyed to Xerta, a little town two leagues above
Tortosa on the Ebro, which they fortified, and where
they established a tête-du-pont: another was formed at
Mora, half way between Mequinenza and Tortosa; the
navigation of the river was thus secured. The roads
upon either bank being only mountain paths, which were
practicable but for beasts of burthen, a military road was
constructed from Caspe, following in many parts the line
of that which the Duke of Orleans had formed in the
preceding century. A corps of 5000 infantry and 500
horse was to invest the city on the right bank, while
another corps of the same strength watched the movements
of the Catalan army. One division Suchet had
left in Aragon, where the regular force opposed to it
had almost disappeared in the incapable hands of D.
Francisco Palafox. He had as little to apprehend on the
side of Valencia; neither men nor means were wanting
in that populous and wealthy province, but there prevailed
a narrow provincial spirit, and General Caro remained
inactive when an opportunity was presented of
compelling the French, who were on the right bank, to
retire, or of cutting them off. The other part of the besieging
army was not left in like manner unmolested, for
O’Donell had by this time recovered from his wound,
and resumed the command.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The enemy appear before the place.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 4th of July the enemy appeared on the right
bank, and occupied the suburbs of Jesus and
Las Roquetas; they took possession also of the
country-houses which were near the city on that
side, but not without resistance. On the 8th they attacked
the tête-du-pont, expecting to carry it by a sudden
and vigorous attempt; they were repulsed, renewed the
attempt at midnight, were again repulsed, and a few
hours afterwards failed in a third attack. They were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
now satisfied that Tortosa was not to be won without
the time and labour of a regular siege. They had seen
also a manifestation of that same spirit which had been
so virtuously displayed at Zaragoza and Gerona. For
the Tortosan women had passed and repassed the bridge
during the heat of action, regardless of danger, bearing
refreshments and stores to the soldiers; two who were
wounded in this service were rewarded with medals and
with a pension. They enrolled themselves in companies
to attend upon the wounded, whether in the hospitals or
in private houses. There was one woman who during
the whole siege carried water and cordials to the troops
at the points of attack, and frequently went out with them
in their sallies; the people called her La Titaya, and she
was made a serjeant for her services. The men also
formed themselves into companies, and it was evident
what might be expected from the inhabitants, if their
governor should prove worthy of the charge committed
to him. Velasco, who held the command till the
Conde de Alache should arrive, was incapacitated by
illness for any exertion. The garrison, encouraged by
their success in repelling the enemy, made a sally on the
10th with more courage than prudence, and lost about
100 men; the next day the French began their regular
approaches.</p>


<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>O’Donell visits the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>O’Donell’s first care upon resuming the command of
the army was to strengthen Tortosa and provide
it against the siege, which if he could not prevent
he would use every exertion to impede and
frustrate. Lili arrived there in the middle of July, and
a convoy of provisions with him: Velasco then left the
place, and retired to Tarragona, broken in health. Stores
and men were introduced till the magazines were fully
replenished, and the garrison amounted to 8000 effective
men. On the night of the 21st the enemy made another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
attack upon the tête-du-pont, as unsuccessfully as before.
Some days afterwards O’Donell came there to inspect
the place; he thanked the inhabitants for the good-will
which they were manifesting, and the readiness with
which they had cut down their fruit-trees and demolished
their villas in the adjoining country, sacrificing every
thing cheerfully to the national cause. He directed
also a sally, which was made with good effect,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

some of the enemy’s works being destroyed:
Lili was present in this affair, and was wounded.
Having seen that every thing was in order here, and
promised well, the general returned to his army.</p>

<p>But O’Donell deriving no support from either of the
neighbouring provinces, had on the one hand to impede
Suchet’s operations, and on the other to act against Macdonald.
Before that Marshal could take any measures
in aid of the besieging army, he had to introduce a convoy

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Macdonald enters the plains of Tarragona.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

into Barcelona. Having effected this object,
and baffled the force which endeavoured to prevent
it, he moved upon the Ebro; by this movement
O’Donell was compelled to withdraw the division
which kept in check the French corps upon the left bank;
and Suchet, seizing the opportunity, passed that corps
across the river, and advanced against the Valencian army,
with which Caro had at last taken the field, ... only to
make a precipitate retreat when it was thus attacked,
and leave the enemy without any interruption from that
side. Macdonald meantime easily overcoming the little
resistance that could be interposed entered the plain of
Tarragona, and took a position at Reus, with his whole
disposable force, raising contributions in money and every
kind of stores upon that unhappy town, while his troops
pillaged the surrounding country. Tarragona was at this
time but weakly garrisoned, and some apprehension was
entertained that it might be his intention to lay siege to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
it. Campoverde’s division, therefore, was immediately
removed thither from Falset, and O’Donell himself entered
the place, and occupied the height of Oliva and
the village of La Canonja, endeavouring by activity and
display to make the most of his insufficient force. Before
daybreak this latter post was attacked by the French in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 21.</span><br />Affair near Tarragona.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

strength, ... the Spaniards fell back till O’Donell
came to their support; he supposed the enemy’s
object was to reconnoitre the place, and this he
was desirous to prevent. Captain Buller, in the Volontaire
frigate, was near enough distinctly to hear and see the
firing; immediately he sent his launch and barge with some
carronades in shore, and anchored the ship with springs
in four fathoms water, to support the boats, and act as circumstances
might require. These boats acted with great
effect upon the right flank of the French; and the frigate
bringing its guns to bear upon the enemy’s cavalry,
which was forming upon a rising ground, dislodged them;
so that they retreated to their position with the loss of
about an hundred and fifty men. On the same day
Captain Fane, in the Cambrian frigate, and some Spanish
boats, performed a like service at Salou, driving from
thence, with the loss of some forty men, a detachment of
the enemy who had gone thither to plunder the place.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Macdonald retires.<br /><span class="date">Aug. 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

On the fourth day after this affair the French
retreated, leaving 700 sick and wounded in the
hospital at Reus, and 200 at Valls. Their rearguard
was overtaken in the town of Momblanch, and the
plunder which they had collected there was recovered:
but a Spanish general was put under arrest for not
having improved the advantage which he had gained.
They suffered also a considerable loss by desertion.
Nearly 300 Italians deserted from Reus, and 400 more
during the expedition.</p>

<p>Suchet with 3000 men had moved down upon Momblanch,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
to cover a retreat which was not made without
danger. This movement left Tortosa for a
while free of access, and large supplies were
promptly introduced. Macdonald now took a
position near Cervera, as a central point, from
whence he could cover the besieging army before Tortosa,
and threaten the rear of the Spaniards upon the
Llobregat, and where he could occupy an extent of
country capable of supplying him with provisions. But

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>O’Donnell surprises the enemy at La Bisbal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

this afforded opportunity to O’Donell for renewing that
system of warfare which he had carried on successfully
against Augereau. He embarked a small detachment at
Tarragona, provided with artillery, which sailed under
convoy of a small Spanish squadron and of the Cambrian
frigate. On the 6th of September he put himself at the
head of a division at Villafranca, having directed the
movements of his troops so as to make the French infer
that it was his intention to interpose between them and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">September.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Barcelona. Leaving Campoverde to throw up
works near La Baguda, and secure that pass, he
proceeded to Esparraguera: from thence he reconnoitred
El Bruch and Casamasanes, and leaving Eroles to guard
that position, ordered Brigadier Georget to take post at
Mombuy, close by Igualada, and Camp-Marshal Obispo
to advance by a forced march from Momblanch, and place
himself upon the heights to the right and left of Martorell.
This was on the 9th: that same night he ordered
Campoverde to march the following morning and join
him at S. Culgat del Valles, sending a battalion to reinforce
Georget, but letting no one know his destination.
The whole division reached Mataro on the 10th, Pineda
on the following day; from thence a party under the
Colonel of Engineers, D. Honorato de Fleyres, was dispatched
to take post at the <i>Ermida</i> of S. Grau, while
O’Donell proceeded to Tordera. Before he left Pineda<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
he received intelligence that the squadron had commenced
its operations auspiciously. Doyle had landed at Bagur,
taken forty-two prisoners there, and with the assistance
of the Cambrian’s boats destroyed the battery and carried
off the guns. Being now about to leave the garrison of
Hostalrich in his rear, O’Donell sent off a detachment
towards that fort, and another toward Gerona, that they
might lead the French in both places to suppose he was
reconnoitring with a view to invest them. On the 13th
he reached the village of Vidreras, falling in on the way
thither with an howitzer and a field-piece which had been
landed for him at Calella. At Vidreras the two last
detachments which he had sent off rejoined him, having
performed their service with great success, the one party
bringing off nine prisoners from the suburbs of Hostalrich,
whom they had taken in the houses there, the other
eleven from under the walls of Gerona.</p>

<p>This long movement had been undertaken in the hope
of cutting off the French who occupied S. Feliu de
Guixols, Palamos, and La Bisbal. The larger force was
at La Bisbal under General Schwartz; and that he
might have no opportunity to reinforce the two weaker
points, it was O’Donell’s intention to attack him there,
at the same time that Fleyres, dividing his detachment,
should attack both the other garrisons. From Vidreras
to La Bisbal is a distance which in that country, where
distances are measured by time, is computed at eight
hours, the foot-pace of an able-bodied man averaging
usually four miles in the hour; but at this time much
depended on celerity. At daybreak on the 14th he
renewed his march with the cavalry regiment of
Numancia, sixty hussars, and an hundred volunteer
infantry, who thought themselves capable of keeping up
with the horse. The regiment of Iliberia followed at a
less exhausting pace; and the rest of the division, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Campoverde, went by way of Llagostera to post itself
in the valley of Aro, as a body of reserve, and cut off the
enemy in case they should retire from the points which
they occupied. O’Donell proceeded so rapidly that he
performed the usual journey of eight hours in little more
than four, the infantry keeping up with the horse at a
brisk trot the whole time. As soon as they reached La
Bisbal, Brigadier Sanjuan, with the cavalry, occupied all
the avenues of the town, to prevent the enemy, who upon
their appearance had retired into an old castle, from
escaping; some cuirassiers who were patrolling were
made prisoners; the Spanish infantry took possession of
the houses near the castle, and from thence and from the
church tower fired upon it. They rung the Somaten,
and the peasants who were within hearing came to join
them. O’Donell perceiving that musketry was of little
avail, and that Schwartz did not surrender at his summons,
resolved to set fire to the gates; but in reconnoitring
the castle with this object, he received a musket-ball
in the leg, the sixteenth which had struck him in
the course of this war. Just at this time a detachment
of an hundred foot, with two-and-thirty cuirassiers, came
from the side of Torruella to aid the garrison. Sanjuan
charged them with his reserve; the cuirassiers fled toward
Gerona, all the infantry were taken, and a convoy
of provisions with its escort fell into the hands of the
Spaniards. The regiment of Iliberia, quickening its
march when it heard the firing, now came up; at nightfall
the enemy were a second time summoned, and
Schwartz, seeing no means of escape, was then glad to
have the honours of war granted him, upon surrendering
with his whole party, consisting of 650 men and 42
officers.</p>

<p>Fleyres meantime leaving S. Grau at two on the morning
of the same day, divided his force, and directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
Lieutenant-Colonel D. Tadeo Aldea, with 300 foot and
20 horse, against Palamos, while he with the same number
of horse and 250 foot proceeded against S. Feliu de
Guixols; 150 men being left as a reserve for both parties
upon the heights on the road to Zeroles. Both were
successful. The Spaniards were not discovered as they
approached S. Feliu till they were within pistol-shot of
the sentinel; and the enemy, after a brisk but short resistance,
surrendered when they were offered honourable
treatment in O’Donell’s name. Thirty-six were killed
and wounded here; 270 men and eight officers laid down
their arms. At Palamos the enemy had batteries which
they defended; but there the squadron co-operated, and
after the loss of threescore men, 255, with seven officers,
surrendered. Seventy more were taken on the following
day in the Castle of Calonge. The result of this well-planned,
and singularly fortunate expedition, which succeeded
in its full extent at every point, was the capture
of one general, two colonels, threescore inferior officers,
more than 1200 men, seventeen pieces of artillery, magazines
and stores, and the destruction of every battery,
fort, or house which the enemy had fortified upon the
coast as far as the Bay of Rosas. The British seamen
and marines had exerted themselves with their characteristic
activity and good-will on this occasion; and Captain
Fane, though suffering under severe indisposition at the
time, had landed with Doyle, and put himself forwards
wherever most was to be done. O’Donell, to mark the
sense which was entertained of their services, ordered a
medal to be struck for the officers and crew, with appropriate<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>
inscriptions.</p>

<p>The Spaniards had only ten men killed and twenty-three
wounded; but O’Donell was disabled by his wound,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and a General who had displayed so much ability, and in
whose fortune the soldiers had acquired confidence
could ill be spared. The system of maritime
enterprise which had been thus well commenced

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The enemy’s batteries on the coast destroyed.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was actively pursued. Upon General Doyle’s
representation it was resolved to attack the batteries
which the enemy had erected upon the coast between
Barcelona and Tarragona, and by means of which, with
few men, they kept the maritime towns in subjection;
they were placed always in commanding situations, ...
boats with supplies lay at anchor under them all day, in
safety from the cruisers, and under cover of the night
crept along shore toward their destination. Doyle embarked
for this service, and with the aid of Captain
Buller, in the Volontaire, effectually performed it, destroying
every battery, and carrying off the artillery and
stores. The same service was performed a second time
upon the coast between Mataro and Rosas, where the
enemy had re-occupied stations; the batteries were again
destroyed, their coasters taken, and the Spanish Lieutenant-Colonel
O’Ronan, who embarked in the Volontaire
with authority from the provincial government, collected
the imposts and levied contributions upon those persons
who traded with France, or were known partizans of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">October.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

French. He had the boldness to enter the town
of Figueras with twenty-five men, and draw
rations for them in sight of the enemy’s garrison; but in
this cruise the Volontaire suffered so much in a gale of
wind, that it was necessary to make for Port Mahon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Captured provisions purchased for the French in Barcelona.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The British ships rendered essential service to the Catalans
at this time, and were at all times useful
in keeping up their hopes, and rendering it
more difficult for the enemy to obtain supplies.
The spirit of the people was invincible; and
under such leaders as Manso, and Rovira, and Eroles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
they were so successful in desultory warfare, that a land
convoy for Barcelona required an army for its escort, and
the French government was informed, that precarious as
the supply by sea was, they must mainly trust to it. Indeed
no inconsiderable part of the provisions which were
sent by sea found its way to Barcelona after it had fallen
into the hands of the British squadron. The cargoes
were sold by the captors at Villa Nova, where there were
persons ready to purchase them at any<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> price: ... these
persons were agents for the enemy; and when the magazines
were full, a detachment came from Barcelona
and convoyed the stores safely to that city, which is not
twenty miles distant. The indulgence also which was
intended for the Spaniards in Barcelona, in allowing
their fishing-boats to come without the mole, was turned
to the advantage of the garrison. There were about 150
of these boats, and upon every opportunity they received
provisions and stores<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, which they carried in for some
time without being suspected.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lili’s preparations for defence.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Suchet meantime could make no progress in the siege
of Tortosa; though the Valencians left him undisturbed
on their side, he could undertake no
serious operations till the other part of his army
could be brought down to complete the investment of
the place, and till Macdonald should be in a situation to
cover the besieging force, which that General could not
do till he received reinforcements, his strength being
wasted by the losses which he was continually suffering
in detail, and by the numerous desertions which took
place. Doyle’s address to the foreigners in the French
service, in their respective languages, had produced no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
inconsiderable effect; copies of it were fired from the
town in shells, and by that means scattered among the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 7.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

besiegers. As soon as it was known that the enemy’s
heavy guns had arrived at Xerta, Lili issued a
proclamation to the inhabitants, requesting that
all who were not able to take arms and bear an active
part in its defence would withdraw, while a way was yet
open: the place, he said, had no shelter for them when
it should be bombarded, nor could provisions be afforded
them. But the invaders, he added, deceived themselves
if they supposed that his constancy was to be shaken by
the fears and lamentations of old men and children and
of a few women, or if they expected to find another Lerida
in Catalonia; for he and his garrison had sworn,
and he now repeated the vow, that Tortosa should not
be yielded up till it had surpassed, if that were possible,
the measure of resistance at Zaragoza and Gerona. He
issued an order also that as soon as the first gun should
be discharged against the place, the door of every house
should be open day and night, and vessels of water kept
there in readiness for extinguishing fires, ... and lights
during the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ferdinand’s birthday celebrated in Tortosa.<br /><span class="date">Oct. 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Buonaparte’s birthday recurred about this time, and
the French general sent a letter into the city,
informing the governor that it would be celebrated
in due form with a discharge of cannon.
Lili corresponded to this courtesy by sending a
similar communication on the eve of Ferdinand’s anniversary;
at the same time he sent the official notice
which had reached him, that the yellow fever had broken
out in certain ports of the Mediterranean, and that some
ships were infected with it: this information, he said,
was given as humanity required, in order that the
enemy might take all possible precautions against the
contagion in those parts of the country which were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
occupied by their troops. The holiday was observed
with its usual solemnities and pageants, as if there had
been no hostile encampment without the walls: in the
morning there was service in the churches; in the
afternoon the holy girdle, a relic of which Tortosa
boasted, was carried in procession, a masque of giants
going before it, accompanied by persons performing a
provincial sword-dance, and followed by all the corporate
bodies, civil and ecclesiastical, and by the military,
with music, and banners displayed. Bull-fights with
young animals who were neither tortured with fireworks
(as is the manner in the serious exhibitions of
that execrable sport) nor slaughtered, were held in the
streets, and the day concluded with a ball, a banquet,
and an illumination.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conduct of the French general concerning Marshal Soult’s decree.<br />See <span class="extlink">vol. ii</span>.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The next communication of Lili to the French general
was not received so courteously by Harispe,
who at that time was left in command of the
besieging army. The Spaniards sent him copies
of the decree issued by the Regency in
consequence of Soult’s infamous edict against
the Spanish armies, both edicts being printed on
one sheet, in parallel columns; Lili sent them with a
flag of truce, saying it was his duty to put the French
general and his commander-in-chief in possession of this
royal decree. Harispe replied, that he should always
receive the Spanish commander’s messengers with pleasure,
when they were the bearers of decent and useful
communications; but in the present instance he must
detain them prisoners of war, inasmuch as they seemed
to have no other object than that of scattering satirical
writings. If this reply had not been accompanied by
an act in violation of the laws of war, it would have
been satisfactory to the Spaniards; for the French general
could not more plainly have shown the opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
which he entertained of Marshal Soult’s decree, than
by thus affecting to believe that it was spurious. The
besieging army, however, had given some examples
of that merciless system upon which the intrusive government
required its generals to act; ... for the bodies
of some peasants were taken out of the river, with many
bayonet wounds about them, and their hands tied: they
were interred in the city, where the circumstance and
the solemnity made a strong impression upon the people.
There was a Piemontese, who, having resided more
than twenty years in Tortosa, went over to the French,
and rendered them all the service which his knowledge
of the place and the country enabled him to perform.
This treason on the part of a naturalized foreigner excited
a strong desire for vengeance; some peasants
watched his movements, laid wait for him, surprised
him, and carried him prisoner into the city, where he
was tried, and condemned to be shot in the back, under
the gallows; that mode and place of death being chosen
as the most ignominious, there being no hangman there.
The besieged were gratified by another act of vengeance.
An officer in the French army, before the serious business
of the siege began, amused<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> himself, from a
favourable station, with bringing down such individuals
as came within reach of his gun. At length a deserter
gave information that this unseen marksman’s
stand was in a house called <i>la Casilla Blanca</i>, upon
which the commandant of artillery, D. Francisco Arnau,
went with his piece to a good station on the bank of the
river, and getting aim at him while he was engaged in his
murderous sport, had the satisfaction of seeing him fall.</p>

<p>Though the enemy had established two bridges with
a tete-du-pont to each between Mequinenza and Tortosa,
they had not been able to render the passage of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
the river secure. Their boats were sometimes intercepted
and sometimes sunk; and everywhere a system
of war was carried on by which the armies of Macdonald
and Suchet were so harassed, that the operations
of the siege were impeded during five months.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Successes of Eroles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Some brilliant achievements were performed in the Ampurdan
by Baron Eroles, an officer who rendered
himself so obnoxious to the enemy by
the activity and success with which he discharged his
duty to his country, that there was an order in the
French army to hang him as soon as he should fall
into their hands. The German troops in Catalonia had
at this time been reduced by deaths, captures, and desertions,
to such a state of inefficiency, that the few
survivors were permitted to leave Spain, and stationed
on the South coast of France; there in the enjoyment
of rest and a benign climate, to recruit their broken
health, before they returned to their respective countries.
Some troops only were left in the garrisons of
Lerida and Barcelona, ... the remainder, a few hundreds
only of as many thousands, gladly departed from a
country in which they had committed and suffered so
many evils. Their place in the Ampurdan was supplied
by a reinforcement of 5000 French, under General Clement;
the new general, to signalize his entrance, entered
Olot with 3000 men, and got possession of the
stores which were deposited there, with which, and with
the spoils of the town, he departed early on the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

second day, having thus far successfully effected
his purpose. Eroles was at Tornadis at this time, where
he had collected his troops; and they were receiving
their rations when intelligence was brought him that
the enemy had left Olot, and were on their way to Castellfullit.
A cry arose from the Catalans that they did
not want their bread and their brandy then; what they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
wanted was cartridges, and to kill the French. The
men knew their commander, and he knew his people,
for what kind of service they were fit, and how surely
they might be relied on in that service. The enemy had
had two hours’ start, but they were impeded with artillery
and plunder, and apprehending no danger, had
made no speed: the Catalans had the desire of vengeance
to quicken them, and performing in less than an
hour and a half what is estimated at a three hours’
journey, they came up with the rearguard at Castellfullit,
attacked and routed it. The French rallied, took
a position on the plain of Polligé, where they were protected
by the cavalry and their guns, and thus awaited
for Eroles to attack them. His dispositions, however,
as soon as he had reconnoitred the ground, were made
for turning both their flanks; and when to prevent this
they attacked his centre, their cavalry were repulsed, the
attempt wholly failed, and they retreated to another
position near S. Jayme. From thence they were driven,
and fell back upon a battalion which had now formed
in the plain of Argalaguer, and were protected by the
buildings in that village; but supposing the few horse
which Eroles then brought forward to be part of a
greater force, Clement withdrew his men to a near
wood, on the other side of a stream. Encouraged by
success, the Catalans attacked them there also, drove
them successively from thence and from Besalu, and
did not give up the pursuit till night closed. In this
affair Clement lost more than a thousand men, the Spaniards
twenty-five killed and fifty wounded: scarcely
any prisoners were taken; the French were persuaded
that no quarter would be given, and in that persuasion
some had run upon the bayonets of the Spaniards,
and some had thrown themselves down a precipice near
Castellfullit. The whole detachment would have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
destroyed if Eroles had had his cavalry, but they had
been detached before he knew of the enemy’s movements,
and the utmost exertions did not suffice to bring
them up in time. The Baron observed with satisfaction,
in his dispatches, that they had been favoured with this
victory by the patroness of Spain, on the<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>festival of
whose conception it had been won.</p>

<p>Such, indeed, was the spirit which the French found
in Catalonia, and such the exasperated temper on their
part which this unexpected and brave resistance had
occasioned, that they said it would be necessary to exterminate
one-half the Catalans in order to intimidate
the other. They found a similar spirit in Aragon; but
there the country had not the same natural strength, nor
was there a single fortress to afford protection to the
people. The army, however, under D. Joze Maria
Carvajal, was again in activity; and though, owing to
the incapacity of their commanders in the first years of
the war, and the want of means in the utter destitution
wherein it was afterwards left, it was never fortunate
enough to perform any splendid or signal service, it
deserved this praise, that for patience and constancy
under the most trying circumstances, this of all the
Spanish armies was that which during the contest deserved
most highly of its country. The severest means
were used to intimidate the Aragonese, but in vain.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Edict against the Junta of Aragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Suchet, as governor-general of that kingdom
for the intrusive government, published a decree,
saying, it had come to his knowledge that
a set of senseless men, who had the ridiculous audacity
to style themselves the Junta of Aragon, had fixed
themselves in the village of Manzanera, from whence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
they endeavoured to disturb the tranquillity of the Aragonese,
by their incendiary libels, and despotically took
possession of the public revenues and stores: he gave
orders, therefore, that they should be pursued, delivered
over to a military tribunal, and be sentenced within
twenty-four hours: that the people of Manzanera, or of
any other place to which they might betake themselves,
should drive them out, or, failing so to do, receive an
exemplary punishment, the Ayuntamiento and the parochial
priest being responsible in their goods and persons
for the behaviour of the inhabitants in this point: every
place which received them was to be punished irremissibly,
and the authorities to suffer ignominious death by
the gallows. The Junta of Aragon, to show how they
regarded this decree, printed it in their own Gazette,
well knowing that nothing could contribute more to keep
up that feeling in the nation which it was their duty to
encourage and to direct. They called attention also to
the important circumstance, that this decree was issued
not in the name of Joseph the Intruder, but in that of
the emperor of the French, King of Italy, and Protector
of the Confederation of the Rhine, of whose
intention to include Spain, if he could, among the states
subjected to him, no equivocal indication was here
afforded. The intrusive government, however deceitful
in its promises, was always sincere in its threats. Of this
every province had abundant proofs, and none more than

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Molina de Aragon burnt by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that in which Suchet commanded. The city of
Molina de Aragon in an especial manner provoked
the vengeance of the invaders by the
disposition which the inhabitants manifested, who, as
often as the French entered it, took refuge in the woods

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 1.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and mountains: the enemy at length set fire to
it on all sides, and three parts of the city were
consumed. But acts of this kind, which proved the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
intention of the invaders to reduce Spain to a desert
rather than leave it unsubdued, served only to confirm
the Spaniards in that resolution which rendered their
subjugation impossible.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bassecourt takes the command in Valencia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While Carvajal impeded Suchet’s operations from
the side of Aragon, some efforts were made from
Valencia; a province where, with ample means,
little exertion had been found, and less ability
to direct it. The Regency relied upon the unexhausted
resources which existed there, believing that if the
Valencian force were well employed, even though it
should not undertake any grand operations, Tortosa
could not be taken by less than 30,000 men. But
when Bassecourt arrived to take the command there,
he found the army in a miserable condition both as to
equipments and discipline, which might have made him
hopeless of success in any other warfare than that
desultory one, wherein inexperienced troops may be
trusted, and in which nothing is lost if they find or
fancy it necessary to disperse and provide every man
for his own safety. Some field-pieces had been sent
from Valencia to the army of Aragon: the French obtained
intelligence of this, and a strong detachment

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 31.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

under the Polish General Chlopisky entered
Teruel to intercept this artillery, when General
Villacampa, for whom it was intended, was at Alfambra,
six hours distant: ... the officer in charge of the
guns endeavoured to retreat with them, but was pursued
and overtaken at Alventosa, and the whole fell
into the enemy’s hands. After this success Chlopisky
sought to inflict another blow upon Villacampa’s division,
and an affair took place between Villel and La
Fuensanta, which the Spaniards considered as a victory
on their part, because, though compelled to retire from
the ground, they had not been pursued, nor had any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
dispersion taken place. Somewhat better fortune attended

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 12.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

a maritime expedition from Peñiscola,
which was planned by General Doyle and executed
by his aide-de-camp, Lieutenant-Colonel San
Martin; by this force the strong tower of S. Juan,
which commanded the Puerto de los Alfaques, was
surprised, and immediately garrisoned and stored; and
thus the enemy were deprived of a port in which their
corsairs and coasters found protection. A land expedition,
undertaken at the same time in the hope of
cutting off a French detachment at Trayguera, failed
altogether; the French had withdrawn in time, and
receiving a timely reinforcement, compelled the Spaniards

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Defeat of the Valencians at Ulldecona.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

in their turn to retreat. No loss was
sustained in this attempt. General Bassecourt
was less fortunate in an enterprise of greater
moment; he projected an attack upon Suchet’s army,
which if it succeeded, should have the effect of breaking
up the siege; ... this general had not yet learnt how
little either his men or officers were to be relied on in
any combined or extensive operations; in full expectation<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
that every thing would be executed as exactly as

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

it had been planned, he left Peñiscola at night,
put himself at the head of his central division,
and reaching the bridge over the Servol, beyond Vinaroz,
halted there to give time for the movements of his
right, under Brigadier Porta, which took the road of
Alcanar. Having, as he supposed, allowed a sufficient
interval for this, he proceeded towards Ulldecona, and
halted a little before five in the morning at a place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
called Hereu. Here he inspected his troops, and promised
them a speedy triumph, when a messenger arrived
from Porta, requesting that the signal for attack might
be delayed, inasmuch as his division had not been able
to get forward with the speed which they had calculated
on. Bassecourt waited impatiently a full hour till day
began to break; then, as success depended in great
measure upon surprising the enemy, he sent his advanced
parties forward to attack the French outposts,
and directed his cavalry to gallop into the town as soon
as the gun should be fired and the rocket discharged
that were the signal for attack. General Musnier’s
division was quartered here; Bassecourt’s made three
attempts to force its position, but not hearing any firing
either to the right or left, he perceived that on both sides
his combinations had failed, and deemed it therefore necessary
to retreat. He succeeded in reaching Vinaroz, ...
there Porta joined him with the right column; there he
halted to give the harassed troops some rest, and to obtain
some intelligence of his left; ... and there the enemy
surprised him. The men instantly took to flight, and
all that his personal exertions could effect, was to keep
a few of the better soldiers together, and, under protection
of his cavalry, reach Peñiscola with them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Captain Fane taken at Palamos.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The disgrace of this affair was greater than the
loss, which the French estimated at 3000 men.
They were more elated by an advantage which
they obtained shortly afterwards against an
enemy over whom it was seldom that they had any real
success to boast. The boats of the English squadron

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 13.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

attacked a convoy of eleven vessels laden with
provisions for Barcelona, and lying in Palamos
Bay, the French having re-occupied that town. The
batteries which protected them were destroyed, the magazines
blown up, two of the vessels brought out, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
the rest burnt, ... and our men, having completely effected
their object, were retiring carelessly, when two
Dutchmen, who were in the British service, went over
to the enemy, and told them that the sailors had but
three rounds of ammunition left. The French were at
this time joined by a party from S. Feliu, and the English,
instead of retreating to the beach, where the ships
might have covered their embarkation, took their way
toward the mole, through the town, not knowing that it
had been re-occupied. The boats made instantly to
their assistance, and suffered severely in bringing them
off, the loss amounting to thirty-three killed, eighty-nine
wounded, and eighty-six prisoners, Captain Fane among
the latter. The enemy behaved with great inhumanity
in this affair; they butchered some poor fellows who had
stopped in the town and made themselves defenceless
by drunkenness; ... and they continued to fire upon a
boat after all its oars were shot away, in which a midshipman
was hoisting a white handkerchief upon his
sword, as the only signal that could be made of surrendering,
till of one-and-twenty persons who could neither
fight<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> nor fly, all but two were wounded, ... when another
boat came to their assistance, and towed them off.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Trenches opened before Tortosa.<br /><span class="date">Dec. 15.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Macdonald now, whose army had been reinforced,
took a position at Perillo and at Mora, to cover
the siege against any interruption on the side of
Tarragona, the only quarter from whence an
effort in aid of Tortosa could be apprehended;
and Suchet, secure from all farther attempts either from
Valencia or Aragon, passed twelve battalions across the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
river at Xerta to the left bank, and in one day completed
the investment of the place. The besiegers had great
difficulties to overcome, the soil being everywhere rocky,
... so that the engineers were obliged to form parapets
and sacks of earth, and in many places to work their way
in the trenches by means of gunpowder. The trenches
were opened on the night of December 20; and the siege
from that hour was carried on with an alacrity and skill
in which the French are never wanting. On the twelfth
night the enemy had established themselves at the bottom
of the ditch; they had then bombarded the city for four
days, ... two days they had been engaged in mining, and
there were three breaches in the body of the place: but
there were nearly 8000 troops within the walls; there
was a brave and willing people, and there were the examples
of Zaragoza and Gerona. They were in no
danger of famine, for the place had been abundantly provided;
there was no want of military stores, and the besieging
army did not exceed 10,000 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>O’Donell’s plan for relieving the place.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meantime O’Donell had concerted a bold and hopeful
enterprise for its relief. He knew that there
were provisions and ammunition sufficient for
two months’ consumption in the city; he had
full reliance upon the disposition of the people, and the
whole conduct both of the garrison and the governor
from the time that the enemy appeared before the walls
had given him reason to confide in both. With his own
force he was aware that nothing could be done against
the besieging army, covered as it was by Macdonald;
but he proposed that Bassecourt should supply 3000 foot
and 500 horse from the Valencian army; that the central
army should detach 4000 foot and 200 horse; that these
should unite under Carvajal with such forces as Aragon
could furnish, make demonstration upon the Ebro as if
their intention was to succour Tortosa, but there turn off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
from the most convenient point, and by forced marches
proceed to Zaragoza, whither O’Donell would at the
same time detach 4000 foot and 400 horse by way of
Barbastro. It was believed that the French at this
juncture had not more than 4000 men in the whole of
Aragon, and the garrison of Zaragoza consisted almost
wholly of convalescents and invalids. Bassecourt assented
heartily to this well-devised plan; from the central
army a refusal was returned, ... perhaps it could not
then have mustered even the small force that was required
from it; but upon receiving this reply Bassecourt dispatched
an officer to the Empecinado, and that intrepid
and excellent partisan cheerfully engaged to co-operate.
Carvajal held himself in readiness; and at no moment
during the war was it so probable that a great success
might be obtained with little hazard. For it was not
doubted that Suchet would precipitately break up the
siege of Tortosa, rather than allow the Spaniards time to
strengthen themselves in Zaragoza; that they could
enter it was certain, ... and no other possible event could
have diffused such joy throughout all Spain. All arrangements
having been concluded between the Empecinado,
Carvajal, and Bassecourt, O’Donell’s aid-de-camp,
who waited for this at Valencia, set off instantly for

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tortosa surrendered.<br /><span class="date">1811. Jan. 2.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Tarragona by sea; contrary winds delayed him
a little while on the passage, ... and he arrived
a few hours after the commander-in-chief had
received intelligence that Lili had surrendered
at discretion.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sentence on the Governor for surrendering it.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There was no treason here, as there had been at Lerida,
but there was a want of honour, of principle,
and of virtue. Seven thousand eight hundred
men, not pressed by famine, not debilitated by
disease, with a brave and willing population to
have supported them, laid down their arms and surrendered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
at discretion to ten thousand French. The enemy
indeed affirmed that the garrison could not have continued
the defence an hour longer without being put to
the sword: the people of Spain thought otherwise; they
remembered Palafox and Alvarez; they remembered
that at Gerona a French army, not inferior to this of
Suchet’s in number, lay ten whole weeks in sight of an
open breach which they did not venture to assault a second
time, though it was defended only by half-starved
men, who would have come from the hospitals to take
their stand there. They remembered this, and therefore
they thought that the governor who under such circumstances
had hung out the white flag, ought himself to
have been hung over the walls. Accordingly sentence
of death was pronounced in Tarragona against the Conde
de Alache for having, it was said, infamously surrendered
a city which he ought to have defended to the last extremity;
and his effigy was beheaded there in the
market-place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col de Balaguer surrendered.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The fortress at Col de Balaguer, which commanded a
strong pass about half-way between Tortosa and
Tarragona, was yielded a few days after Lili’s
surrender, by the treachery or cowardice of the men entrusted
with its defence. Tarragona was now the only
strong place that remained to the Catalans; it had been
the seat of government since the fall of Mequinenza, the
Provincial Congress, which was to have assembled at
Solsona, having then been summoned thither, as the only
place of safety; now its land communication with Valencia
and the rest of Spain was cut off; and Suchet
immediately prepared to follow up his success by investing
it, with less apprehension of any obstruction from
the Catalan army, because the wound which O’Donell
had received at La Bisbal compelled him at this time to
retire to Majorca. The Marquis de Campoverde, being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
second in command, succeeded him. In O’Donell the
Catalans lost a commander who had raised himself by
his services, and whose conduct had justified the public
opinion, in deference to which he had been promoted.
But the spirit of the people was not shaken: they relied
upon the strength of their country, even though the fortresses
were lost, ... upon their cause, and their own
invincible resolution; and they lived in continual hope
that some effectual assistance would be afforded by England
to a province which so well deserved it. The little
which had been given had been gratefully received, and
it had shown also how much might and ought to have
been done.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Commodore Mends destroys the batteries on the north coast.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Maritime co-operation of a similar kind had been carried
into effect on the northern coast of Spain.
About midsummer Commodore Mends of the
Arethusa frigate consulted with the Junta of
Asturias, who engaged to put what they called
the armies of that province, and of the Montañas de Santander,
in motion, if he would take Porlier and 500 men
on board his squadron and beat up the enemy’s sea-quarters.
This it was deemed would draw the French
troops towards the ports in their possession, calling them
from the frontiers of Galicia, which they were then
threatening, give the mountaineers opportunity to act
with advantage, and favour the Guerrillas in Castille,
whom the French were endeavouring to hunt down. The
Commodore had no instructions for an expedition of this
kind, but he saw that it offered a reasonable prospect of
advantage; for if the Junta should fail in their part of
the undertaking, or be disappointed in their hopes, he
might nevertheless destroy the enemy’s sea-defences, and
cut off the supplies which they received coast-ways.
Accordingly Porlier with his men embarked, and the
squadron sailed from Ribadeo. The wind serving for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
Santona, they landed on the beach to the westward of
that place. The garrison there, some 120 in number,
retired with the loss of about thirty men; and the French
commander at S. Sebastian feared that it was their intention
to establish themselves there, in a post which might
easily have been rendered defensible, and would afford
good anchorage during the prevalence of the westerly
gales upon that coast: the utmost efforts therefore were
made to prevent this; and on the second day after the
landing, from seven to eight hundred French attacked
them on the isthmus. This body was repulsed with considerable
loss; but finding that the enemy were collecting
in greater force, the Commodore re-embarked his
men on the following day, having destroyed the fortifications.
Pursuing his object, he demolished all the batteries
upon the coast between S. Sebastian’s and Santander
(those at Castro alone excepted), carried off or threw
into the sea above a hundred pieces of heavy cannon,
and laid that whole extent of coast bare of defence,
without the loss of a single man; and having made about
two hundred prisoners and taken on board three hundred
volunteers, all for whom room could be found, the
squadron returned to Coruña.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Expedition to Santona under Renovales.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The injury which had thus been done to the enemy
was not easily remedied, because artillery could
be carried only by sea to these places, the roads
being so bad, and the country so mountainous,
as to render the land carriage of heavy guns almost impossible.
The people of the country were encouraged
by the sight of their allies, and by hearing of a success
which was reported everywhere, and everywhere exaggerated:
and to profit by their disposition Porlier, who
was one of the ablest partisans that this wild species of
warfare produced, was again landed from the British
squadron. The bay of Cuevas, between Llanes and Rivadesella,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
was chosen for the disembarkation, and arms
and stores were landed with him, in large supply, and
safely deposited, before he entered upon his operations.
While this true Spaniard moved with rapidity from place
to place, disappointing all the efforts of Bonnet to overpower
him, surprising the enemy where they were weak,
and eluding them where they were strong, it was determined
by the Spanish government to avail themselves
once more of the British squadron, and occupy Santona;
and Renovales, who had now the rank of Camp-Marshal,
was sent from Cadiz to Coruña, to command the force
appointed for this service. It consisted of 1200 Spanish
and 800 English troops, four English frigates and one
Spanish, three smaller ships of war, with twenty-eight
transports of all sizes. Part of the plan was, that he
should co-operate with Porlier in an attack upon the
French at Gijon, 600 in number. Porlier and Brigadier

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 16.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Castañon collected their forces at Cezoso, and
were on the heights in sight of Gijon when the
squadron appeared; the enemy, after some skirmishing,
withdrew from the town when they saw that Renovales
was disembarking; the plunder which they endeavoured
to carry with them was taken in their flight, the stores
from the arsenal were put on board the Spanish transports,
and the guns thrown into the sea. Before General Bonnet
could collect a force to bring against the Spaniards
the object had been effected; and when he arrived, and
thought to have surprised Porlier by a night attack, the
Asturians had retreated to Cezoso, and he found only the
fires which they had kindled in their encampment for
the purpose of deceiving him.</p>

<p>The weather which had delayed the ships on their way
to Gijon became more unfavourable after their departure
from that place; and though they reached Santona, and
remained five days at anchor there, it was impossible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
land; the Spanish gun-boats suffered so much that it
was necessary to take out the crews and destroy the
vessels. To remain there was impossible, and it was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 2.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

deemed a fortunate deliverance when the expedition
got into the port of Vivero. While they
were laying there the wind recommenced, a heavy sea
from the N.N.E. drove right into this insecure harbour,
and in the violence of the storm the Spanish frigate
parted from its cable and driving on board the Narcissus
frigate completely dismasted it. The masts of the
Spanish ship were left standing, so that it was driven
clear; otherwise both must have perished, not having
any other anchors to let go. Owing to the darkness and
the tempest, it was impossible to afford any relief: the
Spanish frigate was thrown upon the sand at the head
of the harbour; when day broke, the beach appeared
strewed with the wreck, and of nearly 500 souls on

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Magdalena wrecked.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

board, there were but two survivors. This was
the fate of the Magdalena: the Spanish brig
Palomo was wrecked at the same time, only the
captain and nine men escaped out of two hundred; and
some of the other vessels also were lost during the same
dreadful night. The Estrago gun-boat had parted some
little time before from an English brig which had taken
it in tow, and with great difficulty made the coast of
Bermeo. Seeing that the French were there, the Commander,
Lieutenant Aguiar y Mella, preferred all hazards
to the evil of falling into their hands, and proceeded
along the coast to Mundaca, where a like danger awaited
him. Standing off again, he took a desperate course,
among shoals and islets; and escaping from shipwreck
in a manner which excited his own wonder, anchored in
the bay of Lanchove; where one of the crew swam to
shore, and brought off a little boat, by means of which
the men were just landed before their vessel went to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
pieces. Not knowing which way to bend their course,
they passed the night upon the mountains; and on the
morrow, having been directed by a peasant, when they
reached Sornoza, they learnt that forty of the enemy’s
cavalry were in pursuit of them. They kept together,
however, and, choosing the most unfrequented ways,
travelled by night, in that inclement season, by Uncaya
and the mountains of Leon, Santander, and Burgos; till,
at the end of five weeks, the Lieutenant brought his
whole party safe to Ferrol, and presented himself, with
them, to the Commandant of the marine; giving thus an
example of fidelity and resolution, for which they were
rewarded with a gratuity by the Government, and an
honourable mention in the Regency Gazette.</p>

<p>This expedition was frustrated by circumstances
against which no human prudence could have provided.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Expedition under Lord Blayney.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

An enterprise of greater moment, on the south
coast, was attempted about the same time, and
failed from other causes, but mainly because the
information upon which it was undertaken proved to be
fallacious. The French had experienced less resistance
in Andalusia than in any other part of Spain. They

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mountains of Ronda.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

were, however, far from being unmolested there,
and in the mountains of Ronda the national character
was well displayed, by the incessant hostilities
which the people carried on against their invaders. The
man who struck the spark there had been Professor of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ortiz de Zarate.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Mathematics at Alicant; Don Andres Ortiz de
Zarate was his name. In the early days of this
dreadful revolution, he had taken an active part in the
national cause, and afterwards was employed in service
that required no slight degree of ability, by General
Doyle; but perceiving from the mismanagement which
prevailed in every department, civil or military, that the
south of Spain would be overrun, as the north had been,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
he removed his family to Gibraltar, where, as a professional
teacher, he could have supported them respectably,
if he had not regarded the deliverance of his country more
than his own concerns. But no sooner had the French
taken possession of the kingdoms of Andalusia, than he
obtained a supply of arms from the Governor of Gibraltar;
and going among the villages, hamlets, and huts in the
mountains of Ronda, roused a people who required only
some moving spirit to put them in action: in the course
of a fortnight 6000 men placed themselves under his
orders. For himself he sought neither honours nor emolument;
and when General Jacome y Ricardos, who was at
that time Commandant at the camp of St. Roque, would
have obtained rank for him from the Government, he declined
it, saying, it would be time enough to receive the
reward of his services when the country should be free.
He soon became so popular among these mountaineers,
that when he entered a town or village he was received
with military honours, and the streets were decorated
with hangings by day, and illuminated at night, as at
the greatest festivals. This popularity might not have
been obtained, if it had been necessary for him to levy
contributions upon the people; but he commenced his
operation in happy time, when the enemy had collected
their first harvest of exactions, most or all of which fell
into his hands, and was by him delivered over to the
public service. The enemy, who had expected no such
warfare, suffered severely in it; they lost some thousands,
and <i>El Pastor</i>, as, for some unexplained reason,
Ortiz de Zarate was then called, had become a celebrated
name, when his career was impeded by some of those
intrigues and jealousies which so frequently injured the
national cause. He retired, in consequence, to Gibraltar,
leaving General Valdenebro to command a people who
were now no longer unanimous in any thing except their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
unabated hatred of the invaders. A deputation followed
him there, accompanied by three hundred persons, and
the Commandant of St. Roque’s prevailed upon him to
return; but he would only go in the capacity of secretary
to a military officer. Finding then that things were going
ill, and that half the force which he had raised and
organized was dispersed, he repaired to Cadiz, to inform
the Government of the state of affairs, and require
the repayment of what he had expended in the
service, which was the whole of his own means, and
some allowance for the prizes which he had taken from
the enemy. His personal enemies had been embarked
with him, and no sooner had he entered that city than
he was arrested, put in irons, and thrown into a dungeon.
The Spaniards had so long been accustomed, not to an
absolute merely, but to an arbitrary Government, that
even those authorities whose intentions were truly equitable
were continually committing unjust and arbitrary
acts. After twelve months’ imprisonment, Ortiz de
Zarate, who had thus been treated as a criminal, was
acquitted of all the charges which had been preferred
against him; his honour, loyalty, and patriotism, were
fully acknowledged, and he received payment of his
claims in part. It was of importance to encourage the
mountaineers whom he had put in action, and a plan
therefore was formed for getting possession of Frangerola,
a castle on the coast, between Marbella and Malaga,
about twenty miles from the latter place. The castle
was understood to be a place which might easily be taken
by a coup-de-main; its capture would open a communication
with the inhabitants of the Sierra, and hopes were
entertained that it might lead also to the expulsion of
the enemy from Malaga, where they were represented as
being in no strength: the guns on the mole there were
said to have been removed, and the citadel to be in a</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ld. Blayney sails from Gibraltar.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

defenceless state. In consequence of these representations,
an expedition sailed from Gibraltar, under
the command of Major-General Lord Blayney:
it consisted of four British companies (amounting
to 300 men), and 500 German, Polish, and Italian
deserters. They proceeded to Ceuta, and there took on
board the Spanish regiment of Toledo. This regiment
was said to be perfectly equipped; but upon examination
it was found that there was a deficiency of 148 firelocks,
and that they had been embarked without a single

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

round of ammunition. These deficiencies were
supplied; the squadron soon anchored in a
small bay, called Cala de Moral, and there the troops
landed on a sandy beach, without any to oppose them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He lands near the castle of Frangerola.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It had been proposed to Lord Blayney that he should
disembark near Malaga, and that while he called
off the enemy’s attention on the land side, the
squadron should alarm the city from the eastward,
and the boats push for the mole, and land
a party to assist the inhabitants, who, it was confidently
expected, would take the opportunity of rising against
their oppressors. But Lord Blayney properly distrusted
the information upon which this advice was founded,
and he had little confidence in the motley assemblage
under his command; being not without apprehension
that the confusion of their tongues might affect their
movements in the hour of action. He chose to begin,
therefore, with the castle of Frangerola, which is about
two leagues east of the bay in which he landed. Upon
arriving before it, he found it to be a large square fort,
occupying the whole hillock on which it stands, strongly
built, commanding every part of the beach where
boats could land, and in a state of defence very unlike
what he had been led to expect. When he sent in a
summons to surrender, a resolute refusal was returned;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
the fort opened its fire upon the gun-boats, sunk one,
and occasioned some loss in others. Lord Blayney advanced
close to the works, for the purpose of drawing
the enemy’s attention from the water: here he was contending
with musquetry against grape-shot and stone
walls. Major Grant was mortally wounded in this unequal
engagement, and several men killed; but the
riflemen did their part well; the enemy’s guns were for
a time silenced, the boats took their stations, and he
withdrew the troops. He now directed the Spaniards to
the summit of a hill, with a ravine in front, which would
have been a sufficient protection from any sudden attack;
but the Spanish Colonel objected that it was Sunday,
and that it was not the custom of his countrymen to fight
upon that day. These Spaniards were not in good humour
with their allies, nor perhaps with the service, for
which they had been taken from their comfortable
quarters at Ceuta: by a misarrangement arising from
mere inattention, they had been served in the transport
with meat on a meagre day; and they were discontented
also because there was no priest embarked with them.
Lord Blayney, however, prevailed upon the Commandant
to detach four companies, for the purpose of occupying a
pass near Mijas, and preventing the enemy in that town
from sending assistance to the fort. A hundred Germans
were added to this detachment; the English officer
who conducted this service was persuaded by the Spaniards
to attack the town, though his orders were to act
on the defensive; the consequence was, that he was repulsed,
and obliged rapidly to fall back on the main body.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Failure of the expedition.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During the night, the men were exposed, without
shelter, to a continual heavy rain, such as is
common at that season in those countries, and is
never seen in our climate, except sometimes
during the short duration of a thunder-storm. It was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
accompanied with thunder now. But the night was actively
employed in landing artillery; which could not be
done by day, because the guns of the castle completely
commanded the beach. Soldiers and sailors exerted
themselves heartily; and before daybreak a battery for
one thirty-two pound carronade was completed on the
shore, and another for two twelve-pounders and a howitzer,
on a rocky hill, 350 yards from the castle. Though

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 15.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the artillery could not make impression upon the
solid old masonry of the walls, it destroyed part
of the parapet, and the musquetry did such execution,
that Lord Blayney entertained good hope of success;
when, to his surprise, he learnt that the garrison had
been reinforced before his arrival, that it was in sufficient
strength for him to expect that a sortie would be made,
and that Sebastiani was on the way from Malaga with
4700 foot, 800 horse, and sixteen pieces of artillery; ...
his own force amounted only to 1400 men, and the four
guns which had been landed. These he could not re-embark
under the fire of the castle, and he would not
abandon; and at this time, just as he was about to
strengthen his position, by occupying a ruined tower, the
Rodney, and a Spanish line-of-battle ship, appeared off
the coast, with the eighty-second regiment, 1000 strong,
to reinforce him. Boats were sent off to assist in landing
them, and Lord Blayney was about to station gun-boats
so as to rake the beach; but before either object could
be effected, some 600 infantry, and sixty horse, sallied
from the castle. It was a complete surprise; the British
troops were in front, taking provisions; the enemy made
their attack on the Spaniards and the foreigners on the
left: these men took to flight, and abandoned the battery.
At this moment the troops had pushed off from
the ships, and Lord Blayney, trusting in them and in the
strength of his position, formed the few British soldiers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
who were with him, and retook the guns by the bayonet,
but not before part of the ammunition had been blown
up. A doubt was now entertained whether some troops
who were moving toward them upon the left were friends
or foes; some said they were Spaniards; the German
deserters declared them to be French. The hesitation
and delay which this doubt occasioned enabled the enemy
(for enemies they were) to approach without opposition;
and when Lord Blayney, having ascertained the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Blayney and the British troops taken.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

truth too late, charged them, the conflict ended
in his being made prisoner, with about 200 men,
some forty having been killed. This was the
fate of the English soldiers; most of the deserters went
over to the enemy. The men who were in the boats had
then no course left but to return to the ships, fortunate
in having thus seen the termination of an ill-planned
expedition, without being farther engaged in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Defeat of General Blake.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It had not been supposed that Sebastiani could bring
together so large a body of men as he had put
in motion on this occasion. Some movement
was expected from the inhabitants of Malaga,
but with little reason; for the individuals who had exerted
themselves most in resisting the entrance of the
enemy into that city were, such of them as escaped from
the slaughter, at this time in prison, with their leader,
Colonel Avallo, upon some of those vague charges which,
in Spain, under any of its Governments, were deemed
sufficient grounds for throwing men into a dungeon, and
leaving them there. It had been intended also that Sebastiani’s
attention should have been called off in a
different direction, by Blake, with the central army.
That army was too slow in its movements to produce
any effect in favour of Lord Blayney’s attempt; its head-quarters
at this time were at Murcia, and its advance at
Velez el Rubio. It was not till a fortnight after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
failure at Frangerola, that the French thought it necessary
to take any measures against this ill-disciplined, ill-appointed,
ill-constituted body. The enemy’s troops were
so distributed, that a considerable force could be assembled,
within twenty-four hours, at any point where
their presence was required; but before Sebastiani could

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

reach Baza, General Rey, with one regiment of
dragoons, a regiment of Polish lancers, and a
detachment of infantry, had routed an army which was
exposed in a place without protection, and was completely
broken at the first charge<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>. Between 1000 and
2000 were killed, and some 1200 taken; the officers
here behaved better than the men, for the latter threw
down their arms, and cried for quarter; while, of the
former, all who were made prisoners had received sabre
wounds. The prisoners were in a miserable condition,
appearing half starved and half naked; a large portion
of them consisted of old men and boys, and those who
could not keep pace with their escort were shot upon
the way.</p>

<p>Not discouraged by these repeated losses and multiplied
disgraces the Spaniards continued to pursue that
system of hostility which was carried on wherever the
French were nominally masters of the country; a mode

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Irregular war.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of war destructive to the invaders against whom
it was directed, but dreadful also in its effect
upon the people by whom it was waged. The Junta

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>See <span class="extlink">vol. i</span>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of Seville had, from the beginning of the struggle,
perceived that the strength of Spain lay in
her people, and not in her armies. The Central Junta
also had early acknowledged the importance of that irregular
and universal warfare for which the temper of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
Spaniards and the character of the country were equally
adapted; and they attempted to regulate it by a long
edict, giving directions for forming <i>Partidas</i> of volunteers,
and <i>Quadrillas</i>, which were to consist of smugglers,
appointing them pay, enacting rules for them, and
subjecting them to military law; but it is manifest that
these restrictions would only be observed where the
Government had sufficient authority to enforce them,
which was only where they had armies on foot, and
that when thus restricted, little was to be done by it.
They spoke with a clear understanding of the circumstances
in which Spain was placed when they proclaimed
a Moorish war<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>, and bade the Spaniards remember
in what manner their fathers had exterminated
a former race of invaders. The country, they said, was
to be saved by killing the enemies daily, just as they
would rid themselves of a plague of locusts; a work
which was slow, but sure, and in its progress would
bring the nation to the martial pitch of those times,
when it was a pastime to go forth and seek the Hagarenes.
They reminded them of the old Castilian
names, for skirmishes<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>, ambushments, assaults, and stratagems,
the necessary resources of domestic warfare,
and told them that the nature of the country and of the
inhabitants rendered Spain invincible.</p>

<p>This character, on the part of the Spaniards, the war
had now assumed in all parts of Spain. The French
were no sooner masters of the field, than they found
themselves engaged in a wearing, wasting contest,
wherein discipline was of no avail, and by which, in a
country of such extent and natural strength, any military
power, however great, must ultimately be consumed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
In any other part of Europe, they would have
considered the conquest complete after such victories
as they had obtained; but in Spain, where army after
army had been routed, and city after city taken, ... when
Joseph reigned at Madrid, and Soult commanded in Seville,
... when Victor was in sight of Cadiz, and Massena
almost in sight of Lisbon, ... when Buonaparte had put
all his other enemies under his feet, and in the height
of his fortune, and plenitude of his power, had no
other object than to effect the subjugation of the Peninsula,
... the generals and the men whom he employed
there were made to feel that the cause in which they
were engaged was as hopeless as it was unjust. They
were never safe except when in large bodies, or in some
fortified place. Every day some of their posts were surprised,
some escort or convoy cut off, some detachment
put to death; dispatches were intercepted, plunder was
recovered, and what excited the Spaniards more than
any, or all other considerations, vengeance was taken
by a most vindictive people for insupportable wrongs.
In every part of Spain, where the enemy called themselves
masters, leaders started up, who collected about
them the most determined spirits; followers enough
were ready to join them; and both among chiefs and
men, the best and the worst characters were to be
found: some were mere ruffians, who if the country
had been in peace would have lived in defiance of the
laws, as they now defied the force of the intrusive Government;
others were attracted by the wildness and
continual excitement attendant upon a life of outlawry
and adventure, to which, in the present circumstances of
the nation, honour, instead of obloquy, was attached;
but many were influenced by the deepest feelings and
strongest passions which act upon the heart of man;
love of their country, which their faith elevated and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
strengthened; and hope which that love and that faith
rendered inextinguishable; and burning hatred, seeking
revenge for the most wanton and most poignant injuries
that can be inflicted upon humanity.</p>

<p>These parties began to be formed immediately after
Buonaparte swept the land before him to Madrid, and
from that time they continued to increase in numbers
and activity, as the regular armies declined in reputation
and in strength. The enemy made a great effort to
put them down after the battle of Ocaña, and boasted
of having completely succeeded, because the guerrillas
disappeared before them, dispersing whenever they
were in danger of being attacked by a superior force.
There was nothing in their dress to distinguish them
from the peasantry; every one was ready to give them
intelligence or shelter; they knew the country perfectly;
each man shifted for himself in time of need; and when
they re-assembled at the appointed rallying place, so far
were they from being dispirited by the dispersion, that
the ease with which they had eluded the enemy became
a new source of confidence. They became more numerous
and more enterprising after it had been seen how
little loss they sustained, when, for a time, the intrusive
Government made it its chief object to extirpate them;
their escapes, as well as their exploits, were detailed
both in the official and provincial Gazettes; and the
leaders became known in all parts, not of Spain only,
but of Europe, by their own names, or the popular
appellations which had been given them indicative of
their former profession or personal appearance. <i>El
Manco</i>, the man with a maimed arm, commanded one
band; the Old Man of Sereña another. There was
<i>el Frayle</i>, the Friar; <i>el Cura</i>, the Priest; <i>el Medico</i>,
the Doctor; <i>el Cantarero</i>, the Potter; <i>el Cocinero</i>, the
Cook; <i>el Pastor</i>, the Shepherd; <i>el Abuelo</i>, the grand-father.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
One chief was called <i>el Chaleco</i>, from the
fashion of his waistcoat; he won for himself a better
reputation than might have been expected from such an
appellation: another obtained the name of <i>Chambergo</i>,
from his slouched hat. Names of worse import appear
among them; there was the <i>Malalma</i>, the Bad Soul, de
Aibar, and the <i>Ladron</i>, the Robber, de Lumbier.</p>

<p>A large portion of the men who engaged under these
leaders were soldiers, who had escaped in some of the
miserable defeats to which the rashness of the Government
and the incapacity of their generals had exposed
them; or who had deserted from the regular army to
this more inviting service. Smugglers also, a numerous
and formidable class of men, now that their old occupation
was destroyed, took to the guerrilla life, and brought
to it the requisites of local knowledge, hardiness and
audacity, and the quick sense of sight and hearing
which they had acquired in carrying on their dangerous
trade by night. But the greater number were men who,
if circumstances had permitted, would have passed their
life usefully and contentedly in the humble stations to
which they were born; labourers, whom there were now
none to employ, ... retainers, who partook the ruin of
the great families to which they and their ancestors had
been attached; ... owners or occupiers of land, whose
fields had been laid waste, and whose olive-yards
destroyed; and the whole class of provincial tradesmen,
whose means of subsistence were cut off, happy if they
had only their own ruin and their country’s quarrel to
revenge, and not those deeper injuries of which dreadful
cases were continually occurring wherever the enemy
were masters. Monks, also, and friars, frocked and unfrocked,
were among them: wherever the convents were
suppressed, and their members forbidden to wear the
habit on pain of death, which was done in all the provinces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
that the French overran, the young took arms,
the old employed themselves in keeping up the spirit of
the people; and the intrusive Government paid dearly
for the church property, when those who had been previously
supported by it exchanged a life of idleness for
one of active exertion in the national cause, some to
preach a crusade against the invaders, others to serve in
it. These whom oppression had driven out from the
cloister were not the only religioners who took arms.
Not a few in the parts of the country which were still
free took the opportunity, precious to them, of escaping
from the servitude to which they were bound, disgusted
with the follies of their profession, sick of its impostures,
or impatient of its restraints. Public opinion encouraged
them in this course; the multitude ascribing their conduct
to a religious zeal for their country, while those
who wished for the reformation of the abuses which had
prepared the way for all this evil, were glad to see this
disposition manifest itself in a class of men whom they
justly regarded as one of the pests of Spain. The
General of the Franciscans applied to Mendizabal to
deliver up a friar who had enlisted in his army; but the
application was so little in accord with the spirit of the
times, that Mendizabal’s answer was read with universal
approbation by the Spaniards. “The head of the
Franciscans,” said that commander, “must have forgotten
what Cardinal Ximenes de Cisneros did when he
commanded the army which took Oran. If that prelate
in those days thought of nothing but destroying the
Koran, and substituting the Gospel in its stead, what
would he do now, when the religion of our fathers and
our mother country is in danger? I have taken a lesson
from his Eminency. Let the present head of the order
send me a list of all the brethren capable of bearing
arms, not forgetting himself, if he is fit for service, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
we will march together and free our religion and our
country. Inspire then your friars, that they may be
agents in this noble work, putting away all kind of
sloth; and let no other cry be heard than that of ‘War
against the tyrant, freedom for our religion, our country,
and our beloved Ferdinand.’” While this course was
taken by the monks and friars, it is related of the nuns
in the subjected parts of the country, that they passed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rocca. 240.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the nights in praying for the success and deliverance
of their countrymen, and the days in preparing
medicines and bandages for the sick and wounded
French.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of the guerrilla warfare.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Fewer guerrilla parties appeared in Andalusia than in
any other province, although more had been
expected there, from the fierier character of the
people, and the local circumstances; the land
being divided between the cathedrals, a few convents,
and a few great proprietors, and the greater part of the
inhabitants day-labourers, who were likely to be tempted

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Andalusia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

by the prospect of a predatory life. But
Andalusia seemed as if its generous blood had
been exhausted in the first years of the war; and at this
time the mountaineers of Ronda were the only part of
its population who opposed a determined resistance to
the intrusive Government. Their general, Valdenebro,
tendered his resignation because the Regency had made
him subordinate to the Marques de Portago, who commanded
at the Campo de S. Roque; he had performed
good service there; and it was stated in the Cortes as an
example for imitation, that one or two patriots, and one
or two priests who possessed local knowledge, and were
of ordinary rank, but of extraordinary courage, composed
his adjutants, his aides-de-camp, and his whole staff.
The orator did not bear in mind that Valdenebro was at
the head, not of an army, but of an irregular force.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
Forest-flies these mountaineers were called, to express the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mountains of Ronda.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

pertinacity with which they annoyed the enemy,
and the facility with which they eluded him.
Ready themselves to endure all privations, to encounter
all dangers, to make any sacrifices in the national cause,
they regarded submission in such a cause, when it proceeded
from weakness, as little less odious than the conduct
of those traitors who accepted office under the
intrusive Government; and because the city of Ronda
had made no resistance to the French, they looked upon
the name as disgraced, and called their mountainous
region the <i>Serrania de Fernando</i> VII., to mark their
indignation against the conduct of its capital. If the
spirit of such a people could have been subdued, the
enemy were neither wanting in activity nor in inhumanity
for effecting their purpose. They had light
pieces of artillery for mountain service, two of which
were carried by a mule, one on each side, balancing
each other; the carriages and ammunition-boxes were
made portable in the same way: and their attacks were
so frequent, that in the course of two years there was
one village which they entered forcibly fifty times.
Sebastiani, in whose military command this district was
comprised, was a person who betrayed no compunction
in carrying the abominable edict of M. Soult into effect;
and scarcely a day passed in which several prisoners
were not put to death in Granada in conformity to that
decree. Among the instances of heroic virtue which
were displayed here during the continuance of this
tyranny, there are two which were gratefully acknowledged
by the national Government. Lorenzo Teyxeyro,
an inhabitant of Granada, who had performed the
dangerous service of communicating intelligence to the
nearest Spanish general, was discovered, and might
have saved his life if he would have named the persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
through whom the communication was carried on; but
he was true to them as he had been to his country, and
suffered death contentedly. The other instance was
attended with more tragic circumstances. Captain
Vicente Moreno, who was serving with the mountaineers
of Ronda, was made prisoner, carried to Granada, and
there had the alternative proposed to him of suffering
by the hangman, or entering into the intruder’s service.
Sebastiani showed much solicitude to prevail upon this
officer, having, it may be believed, some feeling of
humanity, if not some fore-feeling of the opprobrium
which such acts of wickedness draw after them in this
world, and of the account which is to be rendered for
them in the next. Moreno’s wife and four children were
therefore, by the General’s orders, brought to him when
he was upon the scaffold, to see if their entreaties would
shake his resolution; but Moreno, with the courage of a
martyr, bade her withdraw, and teach her sons to remember
the example which he was about to give them,
and to serve their country, as he had done, honourably
and dutifully to the last. This murder provoked a
public retaliation which the Spaniards seldom exercised,
but ... when they did ... upon a tremendous scale.
Gonzalez, who was member in the Cortes for Jaen, had
served with Moreno, and loved him as such a man deserved
to be loved; and by his orders seventy French
prisoners were put to death at Marbella.</p>

<p>So wicked a system as that which Buonaparte’s generals
unrelentingly pursued could nowhere have been
exercised with so little prospect of success, and such
sure effect of calling forth a dreadful vengeance, as
among the Spaniards. Against such enemies they considered
all means lawful; this was the feeling not here
alone, but throughout the body of the nation; the
treacherous commencement of the war on the part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
French, and the systematic cruelty with which it had
been carried on, discharged them, they thought, from all
observances of good faith or humanity towards them;
and upon this principle they acted to its full extent.
The labourer at his work in the fields or gardens had a
musket concealed at hand, with which to mark the
Frenchman whom ill fortune might bring within his
reach. Boys, too young to be suspected of any treachery,
would lead a party of the invaders into some fatal ambuscade;
women were stationed to give the signal for
beginning the slaughter, and that signal was sometimes

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rocca, 225, 226. 212.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the hymn to the Virgin! Not fewer than 8000
French are said to have been cut off in the
mountains of Ronda.</p>

<p>There, however, it was more properly a national than
a guerrilla warfare; the work of destruction being carried
on less by roving parties than by the settled inhabitants,
who watched for every opportunity of vengeance. There
were more bands in Extremadura than in Andalusia, but

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Estrdemadura.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

there were not many; for Extremadura was not
in the line for convoys, which always offered the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>D. Toribio Bustamente.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

most inviting prey. The most noted leader in the province
was D. Toribio Bustamente, known by the
name of <i>Caracol</i>, who had been master of the
post-office at Medina del Rio Seco; among the
other horrors which were committed in that unhappy
town after Cuesta and Blake were defeated by M. Bessieres,
the wife of this man had been violated and murdered,
and his son also, a mere child, had been butchered.
From that hour he devoted himself to the pursuit of vengeance,
and many were the enemies who suffered under
his hand for the crimes of their countrymen, till, after a
career of two years, he fell at the pass of Miravete with
the satisfaction of a man who, in the performance of what
he believed to be his sacred duty, had found the death<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
which he desired. Bustamente’s men acquired a good
character, as well for their behaviour to the inhabitants, as
for the courage and success with which they harassed the
enemy: but there were other parties in Extremadura, who
inflicted more injury upon their countrymen than upon
the French. This was the case in La Mancha also; the
Government, with a vigour which it seldom exerted, arrested
some of the banditti leaders, and brought them to
justice; but such examples were too few to deter other
ruffians from pursuing the same course, while the authority
of either Government, national or intrusive, was
so ill-established, that there was no other law than that
of the strongest. One adventurer, however, in this province
raised himself to respectability and rank by his
services, though known by the unpromising appellation

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Francisco Abad, the Chaleco.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of <i>El Chaleco</i>. Francisco Abad Moreno was
his name: he began his career as a common
soldier, and escaping from some rout, joined
company with two fugitives of his own regiment, and
began war upon his own account. Their first exploit
was to kill an enemy’s courier and his escort; and shortly
afterwards having added two recruits to his number, he
presented to the Marques of Villafranca, at Murcia, five
carts laden with tobacco, quicksilver, and plate, which
he had taken from the French, and the ears<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> of thirteen
Frenchmen who had fallen by their hands! His party
increased as his name became known; and he cut off
great numbers of the enemy, sometimes in Murcia, sometimes
in La Mancha, intercepting their convoys and detachments.
Showing as little mercy as he looked for,
and expecting as little as he showed, he faced with desperate
or ferocious courage the danger from which there
was no escape by flight, swimming rivers when swoln by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
rain, or employing any means that might give him the
victory. On one occasion he broke a troop of the French
by discharging a blunderbuss loaded with five-and-thirty
bullets; it brought down nine of the enemy, according
to his own account, and he received so severe a contusion
on the shoulder from the recoil, that it entirely disabled
him for a time; but the party was kept together under
his second in command, Juan de Bacas, and its reputation
enhanced by greater exploits.</p>

<p>One service which Bacas performed diffused a general
feeling of vindictive joy through La Mancha and the adjacent

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ciria, the Nero of La Mancha.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

provinces. D. Benito Maria Ciria acted
for the intrusive Government as governor and
<i>corregidor</i> of La Mancha. He was a man of
information and singular activity, who might have obtained
for himself an honourable remembrance, if he had
displayed the same zeal in the cause of his country
which he exerted for its oppressors. From the beginning
he was suspected of favouring the Intruder, and
had been apprehended on that suspicion before the French
forced the passes of the Sierra Morena; the military Junta
of La Carolina spared him, and upon the first appearance
of the enemy, he proved that his intentions had not been
mistaken, by joining them. From that time Ciria served
them with the rancorous alacrity of a true traitor, insomuch
that he was called the Nero of La Mancha. This
evil celebrity drew on him its proper punishment. Bacas
was on the watch for a favourable opportunity, and as
soon as it occurred, he entered Almagro at the head of
his guerrillas, and seized him in the streets of that city:
the people called out for his punishment upon the spot,
but Bacas felt that the solemnity of a judicial sentence
would make the example more impressive; he carried
his prisoner therefore to Valencia de Alcantara, and delivered
him there to the arm of the law, under which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
suffered as a traitor. A victory could not have occasioned
greater exultation throughout La Mancha; if Bacas and
his party, it was said, had performed no other service
than that of bringing this offender to justice, they would
have deserved well of their country for that alone.</p>

<p>It would have been well for humanity, and honourable
for Spain, if those who were engaged with right feelings
in their country’s cause had always shown this regard to
order and the course of law; but the Spaniards had, under
long misrule, become a lawless nation; the great trampled
upon the laws, and by the people murder was scarcely
regarded as a crime; in their vindictive feelings they
were unrestrained by any religious awe, or any apprehension
of earthly punishment. A squadron of the La
Manchan Crusaders entered this very city of Almagro;
they sacked the house of the traitor who collected the
revenues for the Intruder; and because his wife in her
rage reviled them, professed her attachment to King Joseph,
and threatened them with vengeance in his name,
they killed her; and Ureña, a priest, who commanded
the party, related the circumstance with perfect complacency
in his official dispatch. The heart of the nation
was already hard, and the little which might have been
done by the legitimate Government for correcting the
national inhumanity, and inducing, or at least endeavouring
to induce, a more christian, a more civilized, a more
humane spirit, was neglected.</p>

<p>New Castille swarmed with guerrillas, among whom
were some of the most distinguished chiefs. D.
Ventura Ximenez made himself formidable in
the parts about Toledo, till one day in action
his horse carried him into the enemy’s ranks;
his people rescued him, but not till he had received two
sabre wounds and a pistol-shot. They carried him to
Navalucillos, where he died. A price had been set upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
his head; his body therefore was disinterred by the
French, and the head carried to Toledo, that the dragoon
who had shot him might receive the reward. In this
province there were some of the vilest depredators who
under the name of guerrillas infested Spain.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Guerrilla banditti.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

For as in times of pestilence or earthquake,
wretches are found obdurate enough in wickedness to
make the visitation a cover for their guilt, and enrich
themselves by plunder; so now, in the anarchy of Spain,
they whose evil disposition had been restrained, if not by
efficient laws, yet in some degree by the influence of
settled society, abandoned themselves, when that control
was withdrawn, to the impulses of their own evil hearts.
These banditti plundered and murdered indiscriminately
all who fell into their hands. The guerrilla chief, D.
Juan Abril, caught a band of seven, who made Castille
the scene of their depredations; and he found in their
possession gold and silver bars, and other property, to
the amount of half a million reales. A ruffian belonging
to one of these bands was taken by the French, and in
order to save his life, offered to show them the place
where his comrades had secreted their booty; accordingly
a commissioner from the criminal Junta of Madrid, with
two alguazils, and an escort of forty horse, was appointed
to go with him. The deposit was in the wood of Villa
Viciosa, eight leagues from the capital, and there they
found effects to the value of more than 700,000 reales.
But D. Juan Palarea, the Medico, from whose party the
bandit had originally deserted, had obtained intelligence
of their movements, and intercepted them on their return;
five only of the escort escaped, six were made prisoners,
the rest were killed; and the commissioner was put to
death, as one whose office precluded him from mercy,
and even from commiseration.</p>

<p>Of the wretches whom this dissolution of government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
let loose upon mankind, the banditti were the boldest,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Crimes of José Pedrazuela and his wife.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

but not the worst. A more extraordinary and
flagitious course was chosen by José Pedrazuela,
who had been an actor at Madrid. He assumed
the character of a commissioner under the legitimate
Government, and being acknowledged as such in the
little town of Ladrada in Extremadura, condemned and
executed, under a charge of treason, any persons whom
from any motive he chose to destroy: the victims were
carried at night to a wood, where their graves had been
made ready, and there their throats were cut, or they were
shot, or beaten to death. The people supposing him to
be actually invested with the authority which he assumed,
submitted to him in terror, as the French had done to
Collot d’Herbois and the other monsters whom this Pedrazuela
was imitating. His wife, Maria Josefa Garcia
della Valle, was privy to the imposture, and if possible
exceeded him in cruelty. Before they could withdraw,
as they probably designed to do when they had sufficiently
enriched themselves, Castaños heard of their proceedings,
and instantly took measures for arresting them in their
career of blood. They were brought to trial at Valencia
de Alcantara; thirteen of these midnight murders were
proved against them: it was said that in the course of
three months they had committed more than threescore.
The man was hanged and quartered, the woman strangled
by the <i>garrote</i>. The Spaniards had not brought upon
themselves the guilt of revolution, but they were visited
by all its horrors!</p>

<p>The better guerrilla chiefs maintained order where
they could, and whenever any of the banditti fell into
their hands, ordered them to summary execution. There
was another class of criminals whom they took every opportunity
of bringing under the laws of their outraged
country, ... those Spaniards who took an active part in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
the Intruder’s service. The alcalde of Brihuega was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The alcalde of Brihuega.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

notorious for his exertions against those who
were suspected of corresponding with the national
Government, or in any way aiding it; his
wife was passionately attached to the same cause, and the
Empecinado one day intercepted a dispatch from her to
the nearest French commander: he entered the town,
and made her and her husband prisoners. The dispatch
had provoked a barbarous spirit in the men, for they cut
off the woman’s hair, shaved her eyebrows, tarred and
feathered her, and in that condition paraded her through
the streets; after which they delivered them both to the
Junta of the province for judgment. The Empecinado
seems to have had an especial pleasure in pursuing
traitors of this description. He had set intelligencers

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rigo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

upon one Rigo, who, having affected great zeal
in the national cause, fled afterwards to the
capital, obtained a considerable appointment there, and
became a persecutor of all who carried on any communication
with the Government or the armed Spaniards. This
man was keeping his marriage-day at a house a little way
from Madrid, when, during the wedding-feast, the Empecinado
entered the court-yard at the head of a sufficient
band, and demanded that Rigo should be delivered up,
saying no injury should be offered to any other of the
party. Flight or resistance were alike impossible; the
miserable traitor was surrendered into his hands, and
sent immediately under a trusty escort to Cadiz; the
officer into whose charge he was given being enjoined
not to depart from that city till he should have seen him

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Joseph’s escape from the Empecinado.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

put to death in the great square. Joseph himself
narrowly escaped a similar fate from the same
daring adventurer. He was dining at La Alameda,
six miles from Madrid, on the road to Guadalaxara,
with Gen. Belliard, and a festive party, when their entertainment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
was interrupted by an alarm that the Empecinado
was approaching, and they fled hastily towards
the capital, for not a moment was to be lost. The Intruder
had a second escape on the road from Guadalaxara:
the Empecinado knew his movements, and six days after
the French had boasted of having totally defeated him,
and dispersed his band of brigands, he took post at Cogolludo,
and pursued Joseph so closely that more than
forty of his rear-guard were cut off at Torrejon and El
Molar, before they could come within protection of the
garrison of Madrid. So little indeed had that garrison
the command of the surrounding country, that a whole
party which had been sent out from thence were one day
taken and hung by the way-side, within a short distance
from the walls.</p>

<p>In this dreadful warfare blood called for blood; cruelty
produced retaliation, and retaliation was retaliated by
fresh cruelties. Eight of the Empecinado’s men were
taken in the Guadarrama mountains, and nailed to the
trees there, for the purpose of intimidating their fellows:
such a spectacle had the sure effect of exasperating them,
and the same number of Frenchmen were soon nailed to
the same trees, in the same spirit of inhuman vengeance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Desertion of the Juramentados.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A lieutenant of his party, Mesa by name, went over to
the French, and engaged to bring them the head
of this dreaded partisan; his interest was so
good, and his proposals so plausible, that they
gave him the rank of captain in one of the Spanish regiments
which the Intruder was raising, and sent him with
a company of 200 Spanish cavalry to perform his promise;
when they came near Guadalaxara, the men put him to
death, and joined their countrymen in arms. Such an
example might have taught Joseph and his ministers how
little they could depend upon the Spaniards, who by
misery, or severe usage, were forced into his service.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Half naked and ill-fed, kept in miserable prisons, or at
the hardest work, upon the canals, where such work was
at hand, winter and summer, sometimes up to the middle
in water, they enlisted with the determination of making
their escape. In the course of five months not less than
12,000 entered with this purpose; and on the first opportunity
that offered, whole companies, including the
officers, deserted, with arms and baggage. The celebrity
of the Empecinado encouraged them to these attempts,
and his movements in the vicinity of Madrid facilitated
their escape. Like the other distinguished guerrilla
leaders, he soon obtained rank from the national Government,
but he looked to it neither for pay nor supplies.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junta of Guadalaxara.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The Junta of Guadalaxara used the utmost exertions
to assist him; the members of this Junta
performed their duty with perfect fidelity in a
situation where they were continually in extreme danger,
from the vicinity of a strong enemy’s force. They were
as often in the woods and wilds as in human habitations,
and yet they collected stores, clothing, and money for the
armies, while in this state of outlawry under the intrusive
Government; and they circulated a newspaper which
they printed in the mountains near the sources of the
Tagus.</p>

<p>The Empecinado was supposed to have 500 horse
under his command, and 2,200 foot; but this force was
perpetually varying in number, according to the chance
of war; and the guerrillas generally acted with better

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Medico.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

success in small parties. The Medico’s party
was estimated at 300 horse. This leader, joining
with the band of D. Casimero Moraleja, fell in with
140 of the enemy’s troops, escorting a convoy from
Madrid, about four leagues from Toledo, near Yuncles.
Some twenty <i>Juramentados</i>, as the Spanish recruits were
called because of the oath which was administered to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
them when they entered the Intruder’s service, immediately
laid down their arms; the others, of whom

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fourscore French burnt in a chapel.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

fourscore were French grenadiers under the
<i>Chef-d’escadron</i> Labarthe, took possession of
an Ermida, and refused to surrender when they
were summoned, little apprehending the horrible alternative.
The Spaniards set fire to the building on all
sides; no mercy was shown to those who endeavoured

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Naylies, 275.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to escape from the flames; eight persons only
were happy enough to be made prisoners in time;
the bodies<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> of all the rest were left in the smoking ruins.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cruelties and retaliations.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These details were published in the Regency’s
Gazette; there was nothing revolting to the
public mind in such horrors, because the
Spaniards had been accustomed to cruelties, by the
history of their American conquests (wherein the enormities
of the conquerors have not been concealed), and
by the Inquisition: and if the heart of the nation had
not thus previously been hardened, the nature of this
war must have hardened it. The decree of the intrusive
Government for putting to death every Spaniard who
should be taken in arms had not indeed been carried
into effect; too many had been taken to render this
possible in a christian country; ministers and generals,
who might have braved the guilt, shrunk from the odium
of enforcing such a measure; and it may be deemed
certain, that if the French troops had been commanded
to enforce it, they would not have obeyed. But toward
the guerrillas the soldiers could entertain no feeling
either of honour or humanity: they put to death all

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Naylies, 274.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

who were taken in arms and not in uniform;
not regarding, or probably not considering, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
a great proportion of the regular troops were in that
condition! It was not to be expected that they should
ask themselves on which side the provocation was given,
and with whom the cruelty began. And yet, barbarous
as Buonaparte’s predatory system of war necessarily
made them, and with all the irritation which the guerrillas
occasioned, they were less barbarous than those
who were in authority over them: prisoners whom they
spared in the field were, in obedience to rigid orders,
shot if they lagged upon their march into captivity; and
even after they had entered France, numbers were thus

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Blayney, i. 487.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

put to death in cold blood. All who were regarded
as brigands, who acted in the provincial
Juntas, or against whom any proof appeared of
acting under the Juntas, or giving intelligence or assistance
to the guerrillas, were executed by the summary
sentence of some arbitrary tribunal. Heads were exposed
on poles, bodies left hanging upon the gallows, or the
trees; and in the market-place of large towns, the wall
against which the victims were shot was pierced with
bullets, and the ground blackened with blood! Nowhere
was this system of terror pursued more unrelentingly

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Old Castille.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

than in Old Castille, and yet nowhere were
the guerrillas more active or more formidable.
In ten parties, under known leaders, their numbers were
estimated at 1,300 horse, and 2,500 foot. D. Geronimo
Merino, the priest of Villabrau, known by the name of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Cura.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

<i>El Cura</i>, was the most remarkable of them for
the ferocity with which he acted against enemies
who were made ferocious by the dreadful circumstances
in which they were placed. It was not to be expected
that the Spaniards should make this allowance for their
invaders; but they did not claim it for themselves; they
proclaimed for admiration and example actions at which
humanity should shudder: it became a matter of praise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
among them, as in the days of Pizarro and Garcia de
Paredes, to possess the qualities of a ruffian; and if the
appearance<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> corresponded to the manners and character,
the popular hero was perfect in his vocation. Yet mercy
appears to have been more frequently shown by the guerrillas
than extended to them. They obtained consideration
with their own Government, and with the English,
by bringing in prisoners, and were encouraged so to do;
whereas the French soldiers knew that if an armed Spaniard
were taken he would be put to death, and might consider
it merciful at once to slay a fallen enemy, rather
than deliver him over to execution. The guerrillas also,
by conveying their prisoners to one of the Spanish fortresses,
or to a part of the country where the allies were
in force, obtained a respite, for the time, from that life
of incessant vigilance and insecurity, exertion and exposure,
which, without some such occasional relief, no
bodily strength could have long supported. It was by
the peasantry that the greatest cruelties were committed
upon such miserable Frenchmen as fell into their hands,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rocca, 145.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and by the women, who are said to have sometimes
vied with the worst American savages in
their unutterable barbarities.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Aragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There were fewer of the roving guerrillas in Aragon,
because something with the name of an army
was kept on foot there, and in such a state that
the regular service differed little from the course of life
to which the adventurers were reduced. In no other
part of Spain was the intrusive Government administered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
with greater ability and vigilance, nor more in the spirit
of remorseless oppression and rapacity. The whole
yearly revenue which had been raised in that province
before the invasion, amounted to from ten to twelve
millions of <i>reales</i>: the French exacted twelve per month
as the ordinary contribution; they called for extraordinary
payments when they pleased; and after these
official exactions, the Aragonese were not exempted
from the common lot of their countrymen in being at
the mercy of every plunderer. What guerrilla parties
there were in this part of the country were less heard
of, because on all sides there were chiefs whose reputation,
founded upon repeated successes, drew to their
parties the men who would otherwise have been dispersed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Canterero.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

in smaller bands. Anicio Algere, the
Potter, whose scene of action was about Jaca,
was the only one who obtained any degree of celebrity
here. But along the great line of communication for
the French armies, and especially the high road from
the Bidassoa to Madrid, where it was of most importance
for the enemy to secure the ways, and where most
precautions were taken for securing them, there the
guerrillas were most active and most daring. At the
entrance of the villages houses were fortified with
ditches, parapets, embrasures for field-pieces, and loop-holes
for musquetry, and ditches and parapets across
the roads. These stations served a double purpose; for
here at every step the sick and wounded, who were on
their way to France, were inspected with a vigilance so
severely exercised, that it seemed as if the persons in
authority, who could not escape from this hateful service,
found a malignant satisfaction in disappointing
others of their expected deliverance. They sometimes
remanded men who had passed at several posts; and there
were cases in which the wound or the malady (aggravated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
perhaps, by so cruel a disappointment) proved

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Naylies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

fatal at the very place where the sufferer had
been refused permission to proceed, upon the
plea that he was not sufficiently disabled!</p>

<p>Everywhere, but more especially at Irun and all the
frontier places, accounts were kept for the guerrillas of
the troops, who passed through, both of those who were
entering the country, and of invalids on their way from
it. Every artifice was used to delay the enemy when it
was desired that one of these parties should have time
to come up for attack, or for securing a retreat. For
this purpose the priest or the alcalde would officiously
prepare refreshments, while some messenger, with all
the speed of earnest good will, conveyed the necessary
intelligence. This would have occurred in ordinary
wars; but the treachery with which they had been invaded,
and the cruelties which were continually practised
against them, made the Spaniards regard any
vengeance, however treacherous, as an act of justice.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Alcalde of Mondragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

An alcalde and his son were put to death at
Mondragon for having at different times assassinated
more than two hundred Frenchmen.
When they were led to execution, they exulted in what
they had done, accounting it among their good and
meritorious works; and they said to their countrymen,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Blayney.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that if every Spaniard had discharged his duty
as well as they had done, the enemy would ere
then have been exterminated, and the land been
free.</p>

<p>It was in this part of Spain that the most noted
guerrilla leaders appeared, the Empecinado only excepted;
the most mountainous and rugged country
being most favourable to their mode of warfare. There

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Asturias.<br />Porlier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

were many bands in Asturias; the most numerous
was that which Porlier had raised; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Porlier was a man of family, who had rank in the army,
and his people had more of the feeling and character of
soldiers than was commonly found in such companies.
There were many also in the Montaña, where Longa obtained
a good name. The French endeavoured to counteract
this system of national hostility, in the province of
Soria, by forcing the men into their own service: with
this view they ordered a conscription, and the alcalde of
Valdenebro was put to death by them in Burgo de Osma,
for not having enforced it in obedience to their authority.
They called for all single men from fifteen to forty years
of age, and all married ones whose marriage was not of
earlier date than the year on which this dreadful struggle

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>D. José Duran.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was begun. D. José Duran, an old officer who
had grown gray in the regular service, and
whom the Junta of Soria had appointed to the command
there and in Rioja, impeded the execution of this scheme,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 20.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

by his enterprises and his edicts: he threatened
such of the inhabitants as were disposed to obey
the orders of the enemy, lest their own safety might
be compromised; and he interdicted the use of the word
in that acceptation, saying it was their religion and their
liberty which were compromised by such obedience, and
that no Christian and true Spaniard could incur the guilt
of such a compromise. He forbade any inhabitant of
the province to enter Soria while the enemy kept a garrison
there, on pain of being regarded as a traitor, whatever
motive or excuse he might allege. He declared that
every person obeying an order of the intrusive Government
should be put to death, ... every village burnt, ... so
that nothing might exist in Spain which had contributed
towards its subjugation. Whenever the enemy
approached a village, the inhabitants were enjoined to
leave it, driving all their cattle into the mountains; and
they were commanded not to leave provision of any kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
in their houses, unless it were poisoned; to the end that
either by want or by poison, the enemy, who were employed
in destroying an unoffending people, might be
themselves destroyed. The state of feeling may be
understood in which such an edict could be issued by
a provincial Junta who lived in hourly peril, and whose
dearest connexions were the victims of foreign barbarity;
but when the edict itself was sanctioned by the national
Government—for sanctioned it was by being allowed to
appear in the Regency’s Gazette unannulled and uncensured—it
became a national disgrace.</p>

<p>When the guerrillas of Asturias, the Biscayan provinces,
Soria, or Rioja, were closely pressed by the
enemy, they usually sought refuge in Navarre, or the
higher parts of Aragon: here they had their chief
strength. The French, indeed, complained, in their intercepted
dispatches, that these bands gave the law in
Navarre, levied contributions there, and even collected
the duties at the frontier custom-houses. For this

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Xavier Mina.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

superiority they were beholden to Xavier Mina.
His career was short, but remarkable not less
for the signal successes which he obtained, than for his
hair-breadth escapes. On one occasion he and his little
party were driven to seek refuge on a rock near Estella,
where they defended the only accessible side till night-fall,
and escaped during the darkness by letting themselves
down the precipice by a rope. In the course of
five months after his first appearance in the field, his
celebrity was such that he might have raised an army
from among the youth of Navarre and Upper Aragon, if
there had been means to arm, and officers to discipline
them: owing to the want of these, and chiefly of officers,
he never had more than 1,200 under his command;
greater numbers would have embarrassed him, these he
was capable of directing: voluntary rations were provided<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
for them by the villages, and for ammunition and
money he looked to the enemy, calling the wood of
Tafalla his powder-magazine and his mint. As a farther
resource, he levied the duties of which the French complained,
and he collected the rents belonging to the convents
and churches, as having in this extremity reverted
to the nation; and from these funds he was enabled to
pay liberally and regularly for intelligence. The wisdom
of his measures, not less than the chivalrous spirit of
enterprise which he displayed, made him so formidable
to the enemy, that his capture was considered by them
as more important than a victory, when accident threw

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Xavier Mina made prisoner.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

him into their hands. Chance had delayed the
advance of a convoy for which he was waiting:
he was informed of the delay, but proposed to
wait still; and went himself on horseback with only one
companion, by moonlight, to reconnoitre the ground.
The enemy, who would have thought no precautions
necessary against a Spanish army at that time, stood in
such fear of Mina, that they had formed a double line of
outposts, and sent out patroles; by some of whom he
and his comrade were surprised, dismounted, and taken.
It is remarkable that he was not put to death as soon as
identified, for he had been proscribed as a leader of banditti,
and his capture as such was exultingly announced;
but some person of more generosity than those who thus
reviled him must have interfered; and where so little
that has the character of honour or humanity can be recorded,
it must be regretted that we know not to whom
this redeeming act should be ascribed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Espoz y Mina elected to succeed him.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When Mina’s followers had thus lost their leader,
disputes arose concerning the command; and
there being no one whose personal qualifications
were generally acknowledged, it was resolved to
choose his uncle for his name’s sake, for in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
name there was a strength. His uncle, Francisco Espoz
y Mina, was born in 1781, in the village of Ydozin, upon
a little farm, the sole patrimony of his family, to which
he succeeded on his father’s death. His education consisted
in having merely been taught to read and write;
and husbandry had been his only occupation, till under
the impulse of the general feeling he took arms against
the oppressors of his country; and having, according to
his own account, done to them all the hurt he could as
long as he remained in his own house, he enlisted as a
volunteer in Doyle’s battalion. Soon afterwards, using
that freedom which the times allowed, he joined his
nephew’s guerrilla, and on the evening after the young
hero’s capture, he left the band apparently with the intention
of betaking himself to some other course of life;
a deputation of seven persons followed him, and urged
him to take the command, which having against his will
accepted, he began to exercise with a strength of
character that never halted in half measures. One of
his first acts was to put down those who resisted the
authority which he claimed as commander-in-chief of
the guerrillas of Navarre, and in which the Junta of
Aragon confirmed him. A certain Echeverria had
aspired to this rank; he had some 800 men in his company,
consisting mostly of German deserters, who inflicted
more evil upon the peasantry than upon the French.
Espoz y Mina, with about half that force, surprised and
arrested him, had him shot with three of his principal
comrades, and incorporated the men in his own band.
A gang of forty ruffians, with a woman by name Martina
for their leader, infested Biscay and Alava, and committed
so many murders, that the cry of the land went
forth against them; he dispatched a party, who surprised
half these banditti with their execrable mistress at their
head, and they were sent to summary execution. Espoz<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
y Mina himself narrowly escaped from the treachery of
another adventurer, who for his evil countenance was
known by the appellation of Malcarado. This man had
been a shepherd, and afterwards a serjeant in Mina’s
troop. He, too, intended to make war upon his own
account; but finding that this would not be permitted
by the new guerrilla chief, who suffered no banditti to
exercise their vocation within his reach, he deemed it
better to make terms with the French than be exposed
to danger on both sides; feigning, therefore, to serve
under Espoz y Mina, he gave general Pannetier information
of his movements, ... and drew off the advanced
guard from before the village of Robres, so as to give a
French detachment opportunity to enter while the chief
was in bed. The alarm roused him but just in time;
he defended himself at the entrance of the house with
the bar of the door for want of any other weapon, till
his faithful follower, Luis Gaston, came to his assistance
and brought a horse. Enough of his people collected to
make head against the enemy, rout them, and rescue
their prisoners. Immediately he pursued Malcarado,
and having what was deemed sufficient evidence of his
treason, ordered him to be shot, and the priest of the
village and three alcaldes to be hanged, side by side, as
his accomplices.</p>

<p>A leader who acted always thus decisively, in disregard
of forms, upon the apparent justice of the case, inspired
his followers with confidence, and obtained submission
everywhere. Where his orders were not executed
with the alacrity of good-will, they were obeyed for fear.
The alcaldes of every village were required to give him
immediate information whenever they received orders
from the French for making any requisition: it was at
the hazard of their lives to do this; but so surely as they
failed to do it, they were seized in their beds and shot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
The miserable people were thus continually placed between
two dangers; but their hearts were with Mina;
they were attached to him by self-interest as well as by
national feeling, for he encouraged them to trade with
France, receiving money from the rich traders for passports,
by which means he was enabled both to pay his
men, and to reward his spies liberally; and thus also he
obtained many articles which it would otherwise have
been difficult to procure. Circumstances having forced
him into a way of life which he would not have chosen,
he devoted himself to it with his whole heart and soul;
and his strength both of constitution and character were
equal to their trials. It is said that two hours’ sleep
sufficed for him; when he lay down it was with his
pistols in his girdle, and the few nights which he slept
under a roof were passed with less sense of security than
he felt in the wilds, although his first care was to secure
the doors, and guard against a surprisal. He was not
encumbered with baggage; the nearest house supplied
the wardrobe when he changed his linen; and he and
his men wore sandals that they might more easily ascend
the heights in the hair-breadth adventures to which
they were exposed. His powder was made in a cave
among the mountains; sometimes he obtained it from
Pamplona, notwithstanding the vigilance of the enemy.
His hospital was in a mountain village; when the French
more than once endeavoured to surprise it, timely intelligence
was given, and the villagers carried the sick and
wounded in litters, upon their shoulders, into the fastnesses.
He kept no man in his troop who was known
to be addicted to women, lest by their likeliest means he
might be betrayed. No gaming was allowed among his
men, nor were they permitted to plunder; when the fight
was over every one might keep what he could get; but
woe to him who should lay hand on the spoil before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
struggle was at an end, and the success had been pursued
to the utmost!</p>

<p>In such enterprises as those of the two Minas and the
other guerrilla chiefs, the Timours, the Babers, and
Khouli Khans of Eastern history, were trained; but
neither men nor officers were likely to be formed in them
for the operations of regular war. The restraints, the
subordination, the principle of obedience which the
soldier is compelled to learn, of the necessity of which
his understanding is convinced, and to which, if his disposition
be good, he conforms at last morally as well as
mechanically, these in no slight degree counteract the
demoralizing tendencies of a military life, and compensate
for its heart-hardening ones. The good soldier becomes
a good citizen when his occupation is over; but the
guerrillas were never likely to forego the wild and lawless
course in which they were engaged; and, therefore,
essential as their services now were, thoughtful men
looked with the gloomiest forebodings to what must be
the consequence of their multiplication, whenever this
dreadful struggle should be ended; they anticipated the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sem. Patr. No. 82, p. 338.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

utter ruin of Spain. The course of events, however,
was not to be controlled; circumstances
had produced this irregular force, and there was
now no possibility of defending the country without it.
Lord Wellington had felt how hopeless it was to act in
concert with a Spanish army, wherein good intentions
were frustrated by obstinate counsels, and courage rendered
unavailing by insubordination; but he felt at this
time of what importance it was to have a nation in his
favour, and how materially the movements of the enemy
were impeded and their difficulties increased by the
guerrilla parties who acted along their whole line, from
the Pyrenees to the frontiers of Beira. Massena’s situation
became every day more trying; the French in Spain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
were so little able to feed his army, that he was obliged
to have his biscuit from France, when it had to be escorted
800 miles through a hostile country! It was as
difficult for him to send dispatches as to receive supplies;
and the first intelligence which Buonaparte obtained of
his situation after he advanced to the lines of Torres Vedras,
was brought from London, by persons employed in
smuggling guineas to the continent.</p>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Schemes of the intrusive Government.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with unexampled cruelty, the Madrid gazette
spoke of public diversions, and public projects,
as if the people of that metropolis, like the Parisians,
were to be amused with plans of imaginary works,
and entered into the affairs of the theatre and opera regardless
of the miseries of their country. Needy as the
intrusive Government was, it kept these places of amusement
open, in the spirit of Parisian policy, taking its erroneous
estimate of human nature from man in his most
corrupted state: but the numbers of the audience, and
the accounts of the theatres, were no longer published as
in other times. Schemes of education were hinted at,
and for the encouragement of literature, ... the unction
which such men as Cabarrus and Urquijo laid to their
souls. Canals were projected, when couriers were not
safe even at the gates of the capital; and the improvement
of agriculture was announced, while circulars were
sent to the generals and military governors, urging them
to prevent the destruction of the vines and olive trees by
the troops; and promising that this ruinous course should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
not be continued, if the peasants would be careful always
to provide fuel of their own cutting.</p>

<p>Spain also, like Italy, was to be despoiled of its works
of art. Joseph gave orders that a selection of the best
pictures should be sent to the Napoleon Museum at
Paris, as a pledge of the union of the two nations. This
robbery did not excite so much indignation as a decree,
directing that the bones of Cortes and Cervantes, and
other famous Spaniards who were buried in or near
Madrid, should be translated with public solemnities to
the church of St. Isidro. The Spaniards observed, that
though it was known in what churches some of these illustrious
men had been interred, their graves could not
be ascertained; and they asked whence the money was
to come for this translation, when the Intruder could pay
none of his servants, and wanted funds for things of the
utmost necessity? “But the decree, like many others,
was intended for the gazette, and for nothing else. Nevertheless,”
they continued, viewing the subject with
natural and honourable feeling, “it excites our indignation
that they should affect this veneration for our ancestors,
who omit no means for debasing Spain, and subjecting
her to the infamy of a foreign yoke.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Cortes.<br /><span class="date">April 18.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But the most remarkable of the Intruder’s acts, was
his promise of convoking the Cortes. “It was
long,” his partizans said, “since the Junta had
amused the nation with vain hopes of this benefit,
for which Spain was to be indebted to her new sovereign.”
The object of the intrusive Government at this
time, in calling a Cortes of its own, must have been, to
take off the attention of the Spaniards in those parts of
the country which the French occupied, from the national
Cortes; and that this intention, having been thus
announced, should never have been carried into effect,
is proof how well the unhappy men, who were ostensibly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
at the head of Joseph Buonaparte’s councils, knew the
insecurity of the puppet whom they served. Almost the
last paper which issued from the royal press at Seville,
had been an edict declaring in what manner the Cortes
should be chosen. Upon this subject the central Junta
had asked the advice of the Spanish universities, and
public bodies. Great difficulties had been apprehended
from the obscurity in which the forms of the old Cortes
were involved, as well as from the difference in the
different kingdoms, which had each their own. It was
well remarked by the university of Seville, that these
things were matters of historical research, not of practical
importance; there was now neither time nor necessity
for the inquiry; the present business was to convene
representatives, according to the general principles
of representation, and leave them, after they had saved
the country, to determine the peculiar forms of the
general Spanish Cortes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mode of election.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The plan which the Junta adopted was formed with
reference to established forms, to present circumstances,
and to the future convenience of
election. Cities which had sent deputies to the last
Cortes, were each to send one to this, and each superior
Junta one also. The provinces one for every 50,000
heads, according to the census of 1797; wherever the
excess above that number amounted to one half, an
additional deputy was to be chosen; any smaller excess
was not accounted. The mode of election was so regulated,
as to render undue influence or interference impossible.
Parochial Juntas were to be formed composed
of every housekeeper above the age of five-and-twenty,
excepting such as had been found guilty upon any
criminal charge; who had suffered any corporal punishment,
or infamous sentence; bankrupts, public debtors,
the insane, and the deaf and dumb. Naturalized strangers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
also were excluded, whatever might have been the
privilege of their naturalization. The secular clergy
were included. As soon as the <i>Justicia</i> received instructions
from the corregidor, or alcalde mayor of the
district (<i>Partido</i>), a parochial meeting was to be held,
and the Sunday following appointed for the business of
the primary election.</p>

<p>The Spanish government did well in connecting this
with religious ceremonies. The business of the day
was to commence with the Mass of the Holy Ghost;
after which the parish priest was to preach upon the
state of the country, and the importance of choosing
proper representatives, upon whom so much depended.
Then adjourning to the place appointed, the magistrate
should first make inquiry whether any means had been
used to influence the electors; any person for whom
such means had been employed, being rendered ineligible
and his agents or injudicious friends deprived of
their vote: any person calumniating another, in hope
of impeding his election, was punished with the same
disabilities. The parishioners then, one by one, were
to advance to the table at which the parochial officers
and the priest presided, and there name an elector for
the parish: the twelve persons who obtained a majority
of names should go apart and fix upon one. It was not
required that they should be unanimous, only that the
person appointed should have more than six votes; and
it was compulsory upon him to perform the duty to
which he was elected. The primary election being
thus completed, the parochial Junta was to return to
the church in procession, their deputy walking between
the alcalde and the priest; Te Deum was to be performed,
and the day concluded with public rejoicings.</p>

<p>Within eight days afterward, the parochial electors
should assemble in the principal town of the district,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
and form a Junta, over which the corregidor and the
ecclesiastic of highest rank in the place presided. The
testimonials of the electors were to be scrutinized; the
same religious ceremonies to take place, and twelve
persons chosen in the same manner, to appoint one or
more electors for the district, according to its extent.
They might choose them out of their own number: but
any persons born in the district, and resident in it, were
eligible. The business was to be transacted in the consistory,
a record of its proceedings deposited among the
archives, and a copy sent to every parish, and to the
capital of the province, where the final election took
place.</p>

<p>Here the electors of the district were to assemble. A
Junta should have been previously constituted, consisting
of the president of the superior Junta of the province;
the archbishop or bishop, regent, intendant, and
corregidor of the city, and a secretary. It was presumed
that these persons would all be members of the
provincial Junta; if not, they were called to this duty by
virtue of their rank, and an equal number of members of
the Junta added; this proviso being intended to secure
for the provincial Junta that influence to which their
services entitled them, for which their experience qualified
them, and of which it might not have been easy to
deprive them, even if it had been thought desirable.
The board thus appointed, was to see that the primary
and secondary elections were made throughout the province.
After the same observances and scrutinies as on
the former occasions, the final election was to be made.
The person proposed must be a native of the province,
but it was not necessary that his property should be
there: nobles, plebeians, and secular priests, were
equally eligible; no other qualification was required,
than that he should be above five-and-twenty, of good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
repute, and not actually the salaried servant of any individual
or body.</p>

<p>In this final election, the first step was to elect three
persons successively. A simple majority was not sufficient
here; more than half the electors must vote for the
same person, and the voting be repeated till this should
be the case: three having thus been chosen, their names
were to be placed in an urn, and he whose lot was drawn
was the deputy to the Cortes. A fourth was then to be
elected, whose name, in like manner, was submitted
to the lot with the two which had been left undrawn,
and this was repeated till the number of deputies for the
province was made up. Supplementary deputies were
then to be chosen, in readiness for any vacancy by death;
the supplementaries were in the proportion of one to
three. The number of provincial deputies amounted to
208; that of the supplementaries to 68.</p>

<p>The provincial Juntas were to choose their members
according to the rules of the final elections; observing
also the same general principle, that the person chosen
must be a native of the province. The form appointed
for the city elections was, that where the <i>regidores</i> were
proprietaries, or held their office during life by the
kings appointment, the people should elect an equal
number of electors, in the manner of the municipal elections.
These electors, with the <i>regidores</i>, the syndic,
and the officers who are called the <i>Personero y Diputado
del Comun</i>, were to meet in the consistory, where
the corregidor should preside, and there choose three
persons out of their own body, the final decision being
by lot. All the elections were to be made with open
doors.</p>

<p>Twenty-six members were added for the Spanish possessions
in America and the Philippines. But during
the long interval which must elapse before these representatives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
could reach Europe, supplementaries for their
respective provinces were to be chosen from natives
resident in Spain; and a circular notice was issued, requiring
that all American or Asiatic Spaniards then in
the country would send in their names, ages, employments,
places of birth and of abode. This being done,
and lists made out accordingly, a Junta was to be
formed, consisting of the members of the central Junta,
who should at the time be acting as deputies for the
colonies, or four ministers of the council of the Indies
appointed by the Junta, and of four distinguished natives
of the colonies, to be chosen by the other members;
this Junta was to direct and superintend the election.
Twelve electors for each province were to be chosen by
lot from among the natives of that province then resident
in Cadiz; but if it so happened that they did not
amount to eighteen, that number was to be filled up by
individuals of the other provinces. The twelve then
chosen were to choose their deputies, in the manner of
the final provincial election, first by nomination, and
then by lot.</p>

<p>The archbishops, bishops, and grandees, were to meet
in an upper house: it was required that the grandees
should be the heads of their respective families, and
above the age of 25; and those nobles and prelates
who had submitted to the French government were excluded.</p>

<p>Such was the plan which the commission of the central
Junta decided upon, and which the Junta adopted.
The commission was composed of five members, the
Archbishop of Laodicea, Jovellanos, Castanedo, Caro
and Riquelme; but the two latter members being appointed
to the executive committee, their places were
supplied by the Count de Ayamans, and D. Martin de
Garay. D. Manuel Abella, and D. Pedro Polo de Alcocer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
were secretaries to the commission. The details
were formed, and the official instructions drawn up by
Garay. In their general principles the commissioners
had been chiefly guided, as was expected and desired,
by Jovellanos, the best and wisest of the Spaniards.</p>

<p>There was, however, a difference of opinion in the
commission upon three points of considerable importance.
Riquelme and Caro would have had only one
house of assembly; Jovellanos referred to the English
constitution, as the best model, and one to which in this
point, the Spaniards, with sufficient conformity to their
ancient customs, might assimilate their own. He proposed
also, that certain qualifications of property,
situation, and acquirements, should be required of the
deputies. Riquelme opposed this restriction; and Jovellanos
yielded to the majority of his colleagues with
less repugnance, knowing how well the great body of
the people had deserved of their country. Riquelme
insisted that the Cortes should not assemble without
deputies from the colonies; the other members would
have omitted them in the first assembly, in consequence
of the long and indefinite time which must elapse before
they could be chosen in their respective provinces, and
arrive in Spain. The plan which was adopted obviated
this difficulty. The inadequate number of colonial
deputies is less objectionable than it may at first appear,
when the probable number of persons from whom the
supplementaries were to be chosen is considered; especially
as it was not pretended that the manner in which
the first Cortes was convoked should be binding as a
precedent. “The government,” said Jovellanos, “fearful
of arrogating to itself a right which belongs to the
nation alone, leaves it to the wisdom and prudence of
the nation to determine in what form its will may most
completely be represented in future.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Regulations proposed by the central Junta.<br /><span class="date">Jan. 29.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The last act of the Junta had been to consign to the
Regency the charge of seeing the Cortes assembled,
according to these rules. In this final
decree provision was made for choosing deputies
to represent the provinces occupied by the
enemy; they were to be chosen in the same manner as
the colonial deputies. Here also the important point of
the <em>veto</em> was determined. If the Regency refused its
assent to a measure which had passed both houses, the
measure was to be re-considered; and unless re-passed
by a majority of two-thirds in each house, it was lost,
and could not be brought forward again in that Cortes;
but if both houses, by such a majority, ratified their
former determination, three days were then allowed to
the Regency, and if within that time the royal sanction
was not given, the law was to be promulgated without it.
The Junta endeavoured to confine the Cortes within its
proper limits, by declaring that the executive power
appertained wholly to the Regency, and the legislative
to the representative body; and lest any party should
arise, who should aim at making the Cortes permanent,
or unnecessarily extending its duration, “by which
means,” the Junta said, “the constitution of the kingdom
might be overthrown,” the Regency was empowered
to fix any time for the dissolution of the assembly, provided
it were not before the expiration of six months.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The regency delays the convocation.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This decree, which developed the principles
of the central Junta, and completed their labours,
the Regency did not think proper to make public;
one of the many acts of injustice which the Junta
suffered after their compulsory resignation. The council
of Castille, or rather the <i>Consejo-reunido</i>, in which such
of its members were incorporated as had followed the
legitimate Government into Andalusia, hinted, in a memorial
full of calumnies against the ex-Junta, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Cortes ought not to be convoked; their opinion was
doubtless of great weight with the Regency; and as the
Regents did not conceive themselves bound to follow the
course which the preceding Government had marked
out, they suppressed the edict, and issued in its stead an

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Feb. 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

address, breathing the same spirit as all the
proclamations of the Spanish Government, but
putting off the meeting of the Cortes. “The council of
Regency,” they said, “could well have wished that
your representatives had been at this time in Cortes
assembled, and that the nation itself might thus have
regulated its own destinies. The means which are necessary
for our deliverance would quickly appear at
its energetic and powerful voice. But this means of
preservation has been too long delayed; and evils gathering
upon each other, with the rapidity of a whirlwind,
do not permit that it should be accomplished at the
time and place appointed. The Isle of Leon, where the
national congress ought to assemble, is at this time besieged
by the enemy; from this isle we see their fires,
we hear their artillery, we hear their insolent threats,
and witness their ravages. Their rash endeavours, beyond
a doubt, will fail against these intrenchments,
where the watch-tower is erected which presents to all
good patriots a beacon in the midst of the tempest. But
the Isle of Leon, thus threatened by the enemy, cannot
be at present a proper place for the celebration of our
Cortes; and necessity compels us to delay it till the
present crisis shall be past, and place and time suitable
for so august an assembly can be assigned. Meantime,
none of the measures and forms established and decreed
for the convocation are to be suspended for a moment.
The elections are to proceed, and the members who are
chosen must hold themselves ready to perform their
functions; the intention of the Government being, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
the Cortes shall meet as soon as the circumstances of
the war permit.”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding this language, it is possible that
Spain was indebted for its Cortes more to the annunciation
from Seville that the Intruder was about to convoke
one, than to the inclination of its own rulers. The central
Junta had delayed it not from intentional procrastination,
but from their sense of the difficulty of the task,
and from the deliberation which so peculiarly characterizes
the Spaniards. They had overcome the difficulties,
and framed a plan of representation, which preserved a
due respect to old venerable forms, and was well adapted
to the existing circumstances of the country; this having
been done, as soon as it was ascertained that Cadiz
might defy the enemy there ought to have been no
delay. That was ascertained in February, as soon as
the Isle of Leon was secured from a coup-de-main. But
it was not till the middle of June that a decree was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cortes convoked.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

issued, ordering the elections to be completed
as soon as possible, and requiring the deputies
to assemble in the island during the month of August,
that as soon as the greater part of them were met the
sessions might begin. The plan which the central Junta
framed was altered in one most material point, only one
house being convoked. Had Jovellanos and his colleagues
determined thus, they would still have summoned
the privileged orders; but the Regency, departing
inconsiderately from a resolution which had been the
effect of long deliberation, neither summoned them to
meet apart from the third estate, nor with it, nor devised
any plan for representing them; so that two of the three
estates were excluded as such from the national representation.</p>

<p>Three days of rogation were appointed previous to the
opening of the Cortes, and on the 24th September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
they commenced their proceedings. At nine in the morning

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Commencement of their proceedings.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the deputies assembled in a hall fitted up for
their sittings in the palace of the Regency:
the military were under arms, and they went
with the Regents in procession to the parochial church
of the Isle of Leon, where the Mass of the Holy Ghost
was performed by Cardinal Bourbon, Archbishop of
Toledo. After the gospel, the Bishop of Orense, who
was president of the Regency, addressed them in a
solemn discourse; and then the following oath was proposed:
“Do you swear to preserve the Holy Catholic
Apostolic Romish religion in these realms, without admitting
any other? Do you swear to preserve the
Spanish nation in its integrity, and to omit no means
for delivering it from its unjust oppressors? Do you
swear to preserve to our beloved sovereign, Ferdinand
VII., all his dominions, and in his failure, to his legitimate
successors; and to make every possible exertion
for releasing him from captivity, and placing him upon
the throne? Do you swear to discharge faithfully and
lawfully the trust which the nation reposes in you, observing
the laws of Spain, but changing, modifying, and
varying such as require to be altered for the general
good?” When all the deputies had made answer,
“Yes, we swear,” they advanced two by two to touch
the gospels; after which the bishop said, “If ye shall
do this, so may God give you your reward; but if not,
so may he enter into judgment with you!” The hymn
<i>Veni Sancte Spiritus</i>, and the <i>Te Deum</i>, were then sung.</p>

<p>These ceremonies over, they returned in the same
order to the hall of assembly: the Regents advanced to
the throne, and occupied five seats under the canopy;
the two secretaries of state, who accompanied them,
took their seats at a table towards the head of the hall;
and the deputies seated themselves indiscriminately as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
they entered, the old contest for precedency between
Burgos and Toledo being no longer remembered. The
bishop addressed them, briefly reminding them of the
perilous state of the country, and the arduous duties
which they were called upon to discharge; then desiring
them to elect their president and secretaries from
their own body, he and the other four members of the
Regency quitted the hall, leaving a written paper upon
the table.</p>

<p>A difficulty in point of form at the commencement of
these proceedings was ended by appointing, as it were
at random, two deputies to hold the offices of president
and secretary, while the Cortes elected others. As soon
as the election was made, the secretary read the paper
which the Regents had left. “The five individuals,” it
said, “who composed the Regency, received that charge,
above their merits and their strength, at a time when
any delay in accepting it would have been injurious to
the country: but they only accepted it and swore to discharge
its duties according to their capacity, till the
solemn congress of the Cortes being assembled, should
establish a government founded upon the general will.
That moment so longed for by all good Spaniards has
arrived, and the individuals of the council of Regency
can do no less than state this to their fellow-citizens,
that they may take it into consideration, and appoint the
government which they deem most adapted to the
critical circumstances of the monarchy, for which this
fundamental measure was immediately necessary.”</p>

<p>Upon the motion of Torrero, deputy for Extremadura,
the plan of a decree was then read, which had been prepared
by his colleague Luxan, and which, after some
discussion, was adopted to this effect. The members of
the congress now assembled, and representing the
nation, declared themselves legally constituted in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
general and extraordinary Cortes, wherein the national
sovereignty resided. Conformably to the general will,
which had been declared in the most open and energetic
manner, they proclaimed and swore anew, that Ferdinand
VIIth, of Bourbon, was their only lawful king;
and they declared null and void the cession of the
crown which he was said to have made in favour of
Napoleon Buonaparte, not only because of the violence
which accompanied that transaction, but principally
because the consent of the nation was wanting. As it
was not proper that the legislative, executive, and judicial
powers should remain united, they reserved to themselves
the exercise of the legislative power in its full
extent. They declared, that the persons to whom they
should delegate the executive power, in the absence of
their king, were responsible to the nation according to
the laws. They authorized the Regency to continue
exercising the executive power under the same title, till
the Cortes should appoint a Government which they
might deem more convenient. But to qualify itself for
this continuance of its authority, the Regency should
acknowledge the national sovereignty of the Cortes, and
swear obedience to the laws and decrees which it should
promulgate; for which purpose, as soon as the decree
was made known to them, the members of the Regency

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Oath required from the Regents.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

should pass immediately into the hall of assembly,
where the Cortes would remain till
this was done, having declared their sitting permanent
for this purpose. The form of the oath was
thus prescribed: “Do you acknowledge the sovereignty
of the nation, represented by its deputies in this general
and extraordinary Cortes? Do you swear to obey its
decrees, and the constitution which it may establish,
according to the holy object for which they have assembled;
to order that they shall be observed, and to see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
that they be executed? To preserve the independence,
liberty, and integrity of the nation? the Catholic Apostolic
Roman religion? the monarchial government of the
kingdom? To re-establish upon the throne our beloved
king D. Ferdinand VIIth, of Bourbon? and in all things
to regard the public weal? As you shall observe all
these things, God be your helper; and if you observe
them not, you shall be responsible to the nation, in conformity
with the laws.” The Cortes confirmed for the
present the established tribunals, and the civil and military
authorities; and they declared the persons of the
deputies inviolable, and that no authority or individual
might proceed against them, except according to the
manner which should be appointed in future regulations,
by a committee for that purpose.</p>

<p>Between ten and eleven at night this decree was
passed. One of the members observed, that the Regents
might be gone to bed, if they were not immediately
apprized that their presence would be required that
night; a deputation was therefore sent to them, while
the ceremonial with which they were to be received was
discussed. About midnight four of the Regents entered

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Bishop of Orense scruples to take the oath.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the hall and took the oath. The Bishop of
Orense did not come; the unseasonableness of
the hour, and the infirm state of his health,
were assigned as reasons for his absence, but it
was soon known that a stronger motive had withheld him.
The sovereignty of the nation was a doctrine which the
venerable prelate was not prepared to acknowledge, and
from that hour he ceased to act as one of the Regency.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the following day, the members resolved, as a consequence
of their former decree, that the style
in which they were to be addressed should be
that of Majesty; highness was to be that of the executive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
power, during the absence of Ferdinand, and likewise
of the supreme tribunals. They ordered also, that
the commanders-in-chief, the captains-general of the
provinces, the archbishops and bishops, tribunals, provincial
Juntas, and all other authorities, civil, military,
and ecclesiastic, should take the oath of obedience to the
Cortes, in the same form as the Regency. By another
edict, they decreed that their installation should be
officially made known through all the Spanish dominions,
and everywhere celebrated with Te Deums and
discharges of artillery; and that prayers should be
offered up during three days, imploring the divine
blessing upon their councils.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The decree, by which the Regents were declared responsible,
produced a memorial from them,
requesting to know what were the obligations
annexed to that responsibility, and what the specific
powers which were given them; “unless these things,”
they said, “were clearly and distinctly determined, the
Regency would not know how to act, inasmuch as the
ancient laws had drawn no line of distinction between
the two powers; and thus they must be continually in
danger, on the one hand, of exerting an authority,
which, in the opinion of the Cortes, might not be included
in the attributes of the executive, or, on the
other, of omitting to exert the powers which it involves,
and which at this time were more necessary than ever.”
The reply of the Cortes proved with how little forethought
they had passed their decree. “They had not
limited,” they said, “the proper faculties of the executive,
and the Regency was to use all the power necessary
for the defence, security, and administration of the state,
till the Cortes should mark out the precise bounds of its
authority. The responsibility,” they added, “to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
the Regents were subjected, was only meant to exclude
that absolute inviolability which appertained to the
sacred person of the king.” The whole of a night-session
was occupied in forming this answer.</p>

<p>Among the many erroneous opinions which prevailed
in this country respecting the affairs of Spain, the most
plausible and the most general was that which expected
great immediate benefit from the convocation of the
Cortes; an error from which, perhaps, no person was
entirely free, except the few, who, like Mr. Frere, looked
to the assembly rather with apprehensions of evil than
with hope. But any great immediate advantage, any
rapid acceleration of the deliverance of Spain, ought not
to have been expected, unless it was supposed that the
Spanish deputies would proceed like the French national
convention, and that a revolutionary delirium might have
produced a preternatural and overpowering strength.
There was as little reason to look for this, as there could
be for desiring it. The Spaniards, more than any other
Europeans, are attached to the laws and customs of their
country. Spain is to them literally a holy land; and its
history, being composed for many ages of a tissue of
connected miracles, to the greater part of the people
sanctifies its institutions. But unless the Cortes took the
executive power into its own hands, and gave the nation
a revolutionary impulse, which all circumstances forbade,
it might have been known that the benefits to be expected
would produce little or no immediate effect upon
the operations of the war: if that assembly acted wisely
they would be slow, certain, and permanent.</p>

<p>The mode of election secured a fair representation.
Some of the members were of the French School of philosophy,
and were sufficiently disposed to have followed
the Brissotines, both in matters of state and church-policy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
Having become converts to republicanism in
their youth, and in the season of enthusiasm, they had
imbibed a prejudice against England, which did not
even now give way, though they hated Buonaparte and
the present system of France as bitterly as the great
majority of their colleagues. On this point there was
but one feeling.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>First measures of the Cortes.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first measures of the Cortes indicated a sense of
their power, and a determination to assert it.
Want of precedents, and of experience in the
business of a deliberative assembly, were great
impediments at their outset; they had hardly decreed
the separation of the executive, legislative, and judicial
branches, before they confounded them in their own
practice. Nevertheless this decree was important, for it
was a great object to secure the judicial authority from
the interference of government: that, breaking, they
said, the chains with which the arbitrary power of some
centuries had bound the hands of the most respectable
ministers, justice might now be administered for the
happiness of the people. A commission was appointed
to prepare a report upon the best means of speedily terminating

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

criminal causes. The result was, a
decree that an extraordinary visitation of all
the prisoners should be made by the respective judicial
authorities, and the accused brought to trial with as
little delay as possible; and that for the future, the tribunals
should transmit, through the Regency, to the
Cortes, at intervals of two months, accounts of all the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

causes pendent, and the persons in confinement.
Llano, a supplementary member for Guatemala,
proposed a more effectual remedy; that a committee
should be appointed to frame a law to the same effect as
the Habeas Corpus of the English.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Duke of Orleans offers his services.<br /><span class="date">March 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Cortes found it necessary also to interfere with
the executive. The Duke of Orleans had
offered his services to the Spaniards; the
former government had not thought proper to
accept his offer, but the Regency, a few weeks
after their installation, invited him to take the command
in Catalonia. A century ago their conduct might have
been easily explained, when Lord Molesworth gravely
asked, what could be done for generals, in such havoc
as was then made of them, if there were not so many
younger sons of princes in Germany, who all ran
wherever there was a war, to get bread and reputation?
But pedigrees and patents of nobility were not considered
now as exclusive qualifications for command,
and the conduct of the Regency, in this instance, was
inconsiderate and hasty. When the duke first offered
his services, the Spaniards were in the full tide of success;
and he expected, with good reason, that as soon
as the French armies were disheartened, they would
readily forsake a tyrant, to whom they were not bound
by any tie of duty. Affairs bore a very different aspect
when the Regency informed him, that the obstacles
which had formerly frustrated his desires were now removed;
reminded him of the triumphs which his ancestors
had won in Catalonia; and called upon him to
preserve the verdure of their laurels. The duke was a
man of too much honour and courage not to fulfil the
offer which he had made in more prosperous times.
Accordingly he sailed from Sicily in the beginning of
June, touched at Tarragona, and having been received
there with the honours due to his rank, continued his
voyage to Cadiz, where he landed under a salute of
artillery. The Bishop of Orense had not arrived from
his diocese to take his seat in the council of Regency
when the duke was invited: he therefore was not implicated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
in this transaction, which was in every respect
exceedingly imprudent. There might have been some
apparent cause for it, if the duke had been a general of
great experience and celebrity, or if he could have assisted
Spain either with men, money, or stores; but the
Sicilian court had no means at its disposal: it had sent
a present of a thousand muskets early in the year, and
this was the extent of its ability. On the other hand,
the presence of a prince of the Bourbon line, at the
head of a Spanish army, would have certainly drawn
against it a stronger French force than would otherwise
have been employed, the destruction of one branch of
that house being of more importance to Buonaparte
than the conquest of Spain. That consideration may
have had some weight with the Junta of Seville, when
upon the first outburst of national feeling, Louis XVIII.
wrote to the principality of Asturias, offering with his
brother, his nephews, and cousins, to serve in their ranks,
unite the Oriflamme with their standards, and call upon
the deluded French to rally round it, and restore peace
to the world. So many inconveniences were perceived
in this proposal, that in conformity to Padre Gil’s advice,
no reply was made to it. And though the same objections
did not apply to the Duke of Orleans, there was
an obvious impolicy in inviting a Frenchman to the
command; the central Junta had felt this, and the
Cortes also felt it; they held a private sitting upon the
subject, and the result was, that the duke re-embarked
for Sicily.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second Regency.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Regents did not hold their power many weeks
after the meeting of the Cortes. A new Regency
was appointed, consisting of Blake, D.
Pedro Agar, a naval captain and director-general of the
academies of the royal marine guards; and D. Gabriel
Ciscar, governor of Carthagena. The reason assigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
for this change was, that the members of the former
Regency had made known their earnest desire that the
weight of the administration, which they had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 28.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

supported for many months, under such critical
circumstances, should be consigned to other hands.
Those members were now to experience in their turn the
same injustice which they had shown toward the Central
Junta. Like them, they had disappointed the
hopes of the people; and like them, more from the
inevitable course of things than by their own misconduct.
They were not, however, treated with equal

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 28.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

cruelty. A decree was passed, that they should
give in an account of their administration to the
Cortes within two months, with a view to some future
process. Shortly afterwards, in consequence of a secret
sitting, they were ordered to retire from the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 17.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Isle of Leon, and the place where each was to
reside was appointed, after the arbitrary manner of the
old court. Blake and Ciscar being absent, the Marquis
del Palacio and D. Jose Maria Puig were appointed to
act in their place till they should arrive. When

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 28.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

they were called upon to take the oath, the
same difficulty was found as in the case of the Bishop of
Orense. The marquis being asked if he swore

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Palacio refuses the oath.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to obey the decrees, laws, and constitutions of
the Cortes, replied, Yes, but without prejudice
to the many oaths of fidelity which he had taken to Ferdinand
VII. The president informed him, that he must
take the oath simply, or refuse it. The marquis requested
that he might be allowed to explain himself. Upon
this it was agreed that he should be heard after his
colleagues had been sworn; and that business having
been completed, he entered into an explanation, saying,
“he was ready to take the oath in the form prescribed,
provided those deputies who were versed in theological<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
points would assure him that he might do it without
scruple. All that he meant was more to ensure the purport
of the oath itself, conformably to those which he
had so often taken to Ferdinand; and he had never
doubted the sovereignty of the nation assembled in its
Cortes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tyrannical conduct of the Cortes towards him.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Cortes manifested upon this occasion something
of that precipitation, and something of that
proneness to tyranny, by which the proceedings
of popular assemblies have so often been disgraced.
In this case, as in that of the Bishop
of Orense, they might perhaps have thought that such
scruples disqualified him for the office which he was
called upon to accept; but those scruples ought to have
been respected; and upon no principle of law or justice
could they possibly be considered as a crime. But the
marquis was ordered into custody, and the Cortes met
again that night, to deliberate upon this unworthy business.
One member said, that Palacio had lost the confidence
of the public; he could not act in the Regency,
because he had shown that his conscience was not such
as was fit for a Regent; and his conduct ought to be
investigated by judges appointed for that purpose. Capmany
maintained, that the Cortes itself ought to take
cognizance of the offence; and Arguelles, Oliveros, and
Torrero, agreed in these exaggerated censures of an act
which, even if censurable, amounted only to an error of
judgment of the most venial kind. Arguelles declared,
that should the Cortes retrace a single step, and not go
forward with its decree, respecting the sovereignty of
the nation and their own power, they would give a
triumph to the enemy. It was voted, after a long discussion,
that the marquis had forfeited the confidence of
the nation, and that another Regent must be appointed
in his place. The Marquis del Castelar was chosen.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
Palacio now represented, through the captain of the
guard, that he was confined at this time in a damp room,
to the danger of his health, without having a place to
sit down. It was then ordered, that he should be confined
in his own house, under a guard, who was never
to lose sight of him. This discussion occupied the Cortes
till midnight, and then they entered upon a secret
sitting, probably upon the same subject. Three days
after, it was voted that the marquis was no

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 31.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

longer qualified to act as captain-general of
Aragon; and in three more, discovering how little conformable
it was to their professed principles thus to
proceed to condemnation before trial, the Cortes repealed
the decree, and resolved, that both this case and that of
the Bishop of Orense should be referred to judges
appointed by the Regency, who were to hear the advocates
of the Cortes, of the royal council, and of the marquis,
and to consult with the Cortes concerning their
sentence. Meantime he was to remain a prisoner at
large in the Isle of Leon, upon his parole.</p>

<p>If the Cortes, in the tyrannical character of these proceedings,
reminded those persons who remembered the
commencement of the French revolution of the errors
which were then committed, it reminded them also of a
measure springing from a more generous feeling, but
which, both in France and England, experience had
shown to be an error. A self-denying ordinance

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Self-denying ordinance.<br /><span class="date">Sept. 29.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was passed at the motion of Capmany,
deputy for Catalonia, a man well known for his
literary labours: it enacted, that no member of the
Cortes should be permitted, during the exercise of his
functions, nor for a year afterwards, to accept for himself,
or solicit for any other person, any pension, favour,
reward, honour, or distinction, from the executive power
which at that time existed, nor from any other Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
which might hereafter be appointed. Gutierrez
de la Huerta, supplementary member for Burgos, had
prepared a more rigorous bill to the same effect, which
was to punish the deputy who solicited any employment
for a kinsman within the fourth degree, by expelling
him from the Cortes, and depriving him for four years
of his elective right, and the capacity of being elected.
It was carried by acclamation, that some public testimony
of disinterestedness should be given. There were,
however, a few members cool enough to temper the
enthusiasm of their colleagues, and qualify the vote, so
as to render it somewhat less unreasonable. At their
suggestion, such persons were exempted from the decree,
who, by rank or age, were accustomed to succeed in
military, ecclesiastic, and civil bodies, according to the
rules or statutes. And it was admitted, that cases
were possible in which extraordinary services might
deserve an extraordinary reward.</p>

<p>Two subjects of especial moment occupied much of
the time of the Cortes. The situation of the colonies
was one, which is too wide a topic to be touched on

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Liberty of the press.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

here: the other was the liberty of the press.
Upon the motion of Arguelles, a committee was
appointed to prepare a report upon this momentous
point. Many curious discussions ensued. The Marquis
of Vigo protested against taking the subject into consideration.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 15.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

“He was ready,” he said, “to sacrifice
his life, and even his reputation in the
Cortes, which he regarded more than life, for his conduct
on this occasion; but he would not sacrifice his
conscience.” “Whatever light,” said Arguelles, “has
spread itself over Europe, has sprung from the liberty
of the press, and nations have risen in proportion as that
liberty has been more or less complete among them. By
its influence we saw the chains fall from the hands of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the French nation; a sanguinary faction obtained the
ascendency, and the French Government began to act in
direct opposition to the principles which it had proclaimed.
After having solemnly and by acclamation
declared, that the French republic renounced all conquests,
they gave orders for the incorporation of Savoy;
and the conduct of the Republic uniformly contradicted
the principles of the National Assembly, both in respect
to the states which they occupied, and to their allies.
If at that time we had enjoyed a well-regulated liberty
of the press, Spain would not have been ignorant of
what was the political situation of France, when she
concluded the infamous peace of Basle. Spain then
abandoned itself with blind subserviency to all the successive
Governments of France; and from the convention
to the empire, we followed all the vicissitudes of their
revolution, always in the closest alliance, till we saw our
strong places taken, and the armies of the perfidious
invader in the heart of Spain. Till that moment it was
not lawful for any one to speak of the French Government
with less submission than of our own, and not to
admire Buonaparte was one of the greatest crimes. In
those miserable days the seeds were sown, and we are
now reaping the bitter fruits. Look round the world!
England is the only nation which we shall find free
from these horrors; the energy of her Government has
done much, but the liberty of the press has done more.
By that means, wise and virtuous men were able to
diffuse the antidote faster than the French could administer
the poison, and the information which the people
enjoyed made them see the danger, and taught them
how to avoid it.”</p>

<p>Brigadier Gonzalez affirmed, that whoever opposed
the freedom of the press was a bad Spaniard. This
occasioned a warm reply, and one of those altercations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
followed, which the Cortes was not then so well regulated
as to prevent or to cut short. A priest terminated
it, by saying, that their first duty was to defend
the Catholic, Apostolic, Roman religion, and whatever
was contrary to that religion was bad. Then, citing
the canons to prove that no work ought to be published
without the license of a council, or of a bishop, he inferred
that the liberty of the press was contrary to religion.
The conclusion was perfectly legitimate, but it was
met by an answer not less curious than the argument.
“No person,” said Mexia, “will deny that Christianity
has existed from the beginning of the world; for though
our Saviour was not yet come, those moral precepts,
which are the basis of his religion, and which were
given by Moses, were written in the heart of man. In
like manner, the liberty of the press has existed from the
time of Adam; for printing is a mode of writing, and the
liberty of doing it is the same, whether it be upon the
leaf of a tree, or in wax, or upon paper; and this liberty
all men have possessed. The art of printing, therefore,
where the liberty of the press was restrained, was an
injury to man, inasmuch as it deprived him of this
primitive liberty.”</p>

<p>There was, however, a great number of members who
were by no means prepared to change the opinions in
which they had been bred up; and they listened with
deep attention to those speakers who maintained that it
was both for the interest of the writer and the public,
that books should be subjected rather to a previous
censure, than to an after responsibility. The result
was not less characteristic than the long and animated
discussions which preceded it. After declaring that all
persons were at liberty to publish their sentiments without
any license, the Cortes unanimously admitted an
amendment which, by inserting the word political, curtailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
this liberty of half its extent: and all writings
upon religious matters were left subject to the previous
censure of the ecclesiastic authorities, according to the
decree of the Council of Trent. Anonymous publication
was allowed, but the printer was to put his name and
place of abode; and if, in case of an offence against the
laws, he did not make known the author, he was to incur
the punishment himself. For the purpose of securing
the freedom of the press, and providing against its
abuse, the Cortes was to appoint a supreme board of
censure, composed of nine individuals, who were to
reside near the Government; and a similar board of five
members in every provincial capital; three of the nine,
and two of the five, being secular clergy. The business
of the provincial boards was to examine such works as
were denounced; and upon their sentence the judges
were to suppress the book, and call in the copies which
might have been sold; but their sentence was not definitive.
The author or printer might demand a copy of
the censure, and lay it before the supreme board: the
supreme board might require them to revise their sentence;
but their second opinion was to be final. If the
book were suppressed, as a private libel, the individual
aggrieved had still his remedy at law against the libeller.
Some appeal was allowed against the decision of the
ordinary. He was not to refuse his license without assigning
the ground of refusal, and hearing what the
author, editor, or printer could allege in behalf of the
work. If he then persisted in his refusal, the person interested
might lay his censure before the supreme board,
and refer the book to their judgment; if they found it
worthy of approbation, their opinion was to be communicated
to the ordinary, that he, being better informed
upon the matter, might grant the license if he thought
good, in order to prevent any farther appeal; but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
that was to be was not stated. This was not the only
point which, by a sort of compromise, was left doubtful
in the decree. The article which empowered the supreme
board to reverse the sentence of the provincial
ones, declared, as it was originally worded, that upon
their approbation the book should freely circulate, and
that no tribunal should impede it. Some members
upon this required that a proviso should be inserted,
declaring this was not intended to intrench upon the
authority of the Inquisition. To avoid such a recognition
of that baleful power, Luxan proposed that the
latter part of the sentence should be omitted, and this
was carried by a majority of two votes. It was a victory
for the liberal party to leave the question undecided.
As soon as the discussion was concluded, a deputy
moved that special and honourable mention of the Inquisition
should be made in the decree; but the president
prevented any debates upon this inflammatory subject
by replying, that it might be taken into consideration at
some future time.</p>

<p>Thus having admitted that public opinion was the
proper and indispensable check upon the proceedings
of Government, the Cortes instituted a board nominated
by Government to be a check upon public opinion,
which, if the measure had not been merely nugatory,
would have virtually destroyed the freedom it pretended
to establish. But they were dealing with no easy subject.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of the press.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The press, like other prisoners, had
broken loose when the old system was overthrown.
It had effected the momentous service of
rousing the nation, and it continued to keep up the
spirit which it had excited; but as for exercising any
salutary restraint upon the proceedings of the Government,
this was of all things what the public writers
were least competent to do, and the men in power least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
likely to tolerate. The danger was, that the press
might now, at the same time, inflame and misdirect the
public mind; a work for which eager volunteers are
never wanting in such times. The Spaniards had
taken arms to defend their institutions, to which with all
their enormous abuses the people were devoutly attached.
The best and wisest men wished to reform
those abuses. Such men were few, and aiming only at
what was lawful and just, they scrupled at any evil
means for bringing it about. The party who were for
destroying root and branch had no such principle to impede
them. Despotism had made them republicans, and
an abominable superstition had driven them into unbelief.
They also were few, but they were more numerous
than men whose opinions rested upon a safer ground;
they were bold and they were indefatigable, acting like
some of the early propagandists and victims of the
French revolution, in the enthusiastic belief that nothing
but good could result from the subversion of corrupted
establishments. Even in the Cortes there were
some who looked to the most dreadful stage of that
revolution rather as an example than a warning. One
member wished for what he called a Christian Robespierre
to save the country; another, for <i>un pequeño
Robespierre</i>, one who would carry on a system of terror

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Diario de las Cortes, T. 2. 441. T. 4. 371.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with a little more moderation than had been used
in France; caustics they said were called for;
matters must be carried on with energy and
with blood, or the country was lost; heads must be
stricken off, and that speedily; it was necessary to shed
more Spanish blood than French. When such language
was uttered in the Cortes, and circulated in the diaries
of that assembly, it was, indeed, most necessary that
efficient measures should be taken for restraining the
license of the press. A journal was published under the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>El Robespierre Español.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

title of “The Spanish Robespierre,” breathing the same
spirit as these speeches. One of its numbers
was suppressed: the fanatical author exclaimed
against this as an outrage upon the sacred,
the divine, the omnipotent liberty of the press. “I
swear,” said he, “upon the altar of the country, no one
is more a Spaniard than I. I more than any one abhor
despotism and its vile satellites. I alone am sufficient
to overthrow them, and reduce that infernal monster to
nothing. My soul is more untamable than the planets,
more elevated than the firmament itself, more great than
the whole universe.” Even such ravings were not to be
overlooked when, in the same number, it was asserted,
that the minister who had suppressed his former paper
had conspired against the liberty of the nation; that,
therefore, he was guilty of treason, and consequently
ought to be publicly hanged without the least delay.
Yet the necessity of reform, ... of a change in the spirit
of the Spanish Government, which under all its changes
of form had remained the same, was shown in the treatment
of this revolutionist. He was cast into prison, and
left there, it was said in the Cortes, till he was half
rotten, waiting indefinitely for the decision of his case,
which they who prosecuted him were never likely to
think of more!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Debates concerning Ferdinand.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At the motion of Perez de Castro, the Cortes voted a
monument as a mark of gratitude to George III.
and the British nation. They declared, at the
same time, that the Spaniards would never lay
down their arms till they had secured their independence,
with the absolute integrity of their monarchy in both
worlds, and till they had recovered their king. But
though the restoration of Ferdinand was thus spoken of
in this decree, there were many who perceived the evils
with which his return was likely to be attended. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
most cautious reformers, however loyal, knew but too
well that his presence might prove a serious impediment
to any reformation; the more theoretical ones could hope
to effect their schemes only in his absence; and at this
time it seemed probable that he might soon return, under
circumstances which all true Spaniards, however widely
differing upon other points, regarded with equal apprehension.
The accounts which had been officially published
in France of Kolli’s adventure represented Ferdinand
as still soliciting to be adopted by marriage into
the family of the tyrant who had betrayed him. The
Spanish Government, with the timid impolicy which
continued to characterize it in such things, had not permitted
the statement to appear in the Spanish newspapers;
the substance of it, nevertheless, was well known
at Cadiz, and many things tended to accredit it. For it
was well understood, that the Intruder was weary of his
miserable position, that Buonaparte was not less weary
of supporting him there, and that the French generals
were disgusted with the odious service in which they
were employed. They were said to have reported everywhere
that Ferdinand, with Buonaparte’s consent, had
contracted the desired marriage (according to one
account, it was with an Austrian archduchess), and that
Buonaparte in consequence would replace him on the
throne. There was intelligence from Madrid that a
Spanish army of 30,000 men was about to be raised for
him. The scheme was politic enough in all its parts to
be deemed probable: it would have the cordial approbation
of the Intruder’s adherents; and all who regarded
only their own selfish views, all who desponded, all who
were impatient under privations and sufferings, all who
desired repose, might be expected to concur in it. The
youth, the inexperience, the defective education, the
alleged simplicity of Ferdinand’s character, were to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
borne in mind: as through these he had formerly been
entrapped, so might he now be made the instrument of
Buonaparte, who would thus seek to obtain by intrigue
what he was unable to win by force. Against this it
was necessary to be prepared. Long and animated discussions
were held upon this matter. It was moved,
that if Ferdinand should cede any portion of the Spanish
dominions to France, all persons obeying his orders to
that effect should be declared traitors: that any marriage
which he might contract under these circumstances should
be declared null, (a proposition against which some of
the ecclesiastics in the Cortes exclaimed as contrary to
the principles of sound theology): that if he entered
Spain as Buonaparte’s ally, he must be rejected, and
war carried on against him under the black flag. Now
was the time to engrave with the point of the sword
upon their hearts that holy Catholic religion in which
they must establish their trust! To the petition in the
Litany which prayed for deliverance from the deceits of
the Devil, they should add, from the deceits of the
French also. Rather than thus be deceived and debased,
it were better that whole Spain should be made what
Numantia and Saguntum had been: then might the
Spaniards look down from heaven, and see whether
these impious invaders would be bold enough to walk
tranquilly through the silent abodes of their tremendous<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>
ghosts!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Decree concerning Ferdinand.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Cortes faithfully represented the nation in their feelings
on this subject; and accordingly they issued
a decree, declaring null and of no effect all treaties
or transactions of any kind which Ferdinand
should authorize while he remained in duresse, whether in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the enemy’s country or in Spain, so long as he was under
the direct or indirect influence of the Usurper. The nation,
it was proclaimed, would never consider him free,
nor render him obedience, till they should see him in the
midst of his true subjects, and in the bosom of the national
congress: nor would they lay down their arms,
nor listen to any proposal for an accommodation of any
kind, till Spain had been completely evacuated by the
troops which had so unjustly invaded it. At the time
when this brave decree was passed, the condition of
Spain appeared hopeless to those persons by whom moral
causes are overlooked, and from whose philosophy all
consideration of Providence is dismissed. Fortress
after fortress had fallen; army after army had been destroyed,
till the Spaniards had no longer anything in the
field which could even pretend to the name, except the
force under Romana with Lord Wellington. The enemy
surrounded the bay of Cadiz, and were masters of
the adjacent country, wherever they could cover it
with their troops, or scour it with their cavalry. Yet
in the sight of these enemies, from the neck of land
which they thus beleaguered, the Cortes legislated for
Spain; and its proceedings, though the Intruder and his
unhappy adherents affected to despise them, were regarded
with the deepest anxiety throughout the Peninsula,
and wherever the Spanish language extends. There
is no other example in history of so singular a position.
During the three years which had elapsed since the
commencement of the struggle, Buonaparte had not only
increased his power, but seemed also to have consolidated
and established it; while Spain had endured all
the evils of revolution without acquiring a revolutionary
strength; and, what appeared more surprising, none of
those commanding spirits which revolutions usually
bring forth had arisen there. Enlightened Spaniards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
had with one consent called for the Cortes, as the surest
remedy for their country; and in England they who were
most friendly to the Spaniards, and they who were least
so, had agreed in the propriety of convoking it. Long
as the Cortes had been suspended, it was still a venerable
name; and its restoration gladdened the hearts of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Character of the Cortes.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

people. A fairer representation could not have
been obtained if the whole kingdom had been
free, nor a greater proportion of able men; the
circumstances, also, in which they were placed, increased
their claims to respect among a people by whom poverty
has never been despised. Many of the members, having
lost their whole property in the general wreck, were
dependent upon friendship even for their food. For
although a stipend was appointed, some of those provinces
which were occupied by the enemy could find no
means of paying it; and no provision for remedying this
default had been yet devised. They who had professions
could not support themselves by practising, because
the business of the Cortes engrossed their whole
attention. The self-denying ordinance, which they had
passed, excluded them from offices of emolument; and
there were deputies who sometimes had not wherewith
to buy oil for a lamp to give them light. Under these
circumstances they respected themselves, and were respected
by the nation according to the true standard of
their worth.</p>

<p>But as the Cortes faithfully represented the characteristic
virtues of the nation, they represented with
equal fidelity its defects. The majority were scarcely
less bigoted than the most illiterate of their countrymen;
and they prided themselves upon having made the
assembly swear to preserve the Romish as the exclusive
religion of Spain: this, they said, was one of the things
which reflected most lustre upon the Cortes. Their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
opponents, who designated themselves as the Liberal
party, assented to what they could neither with prudence
nor safety have opposed; and they swore, accordingly,
to maintain in its domination and intolerance a
corrupt religion which they despised and hated. Disbelief
is too weak a word for expressing the feelings of a
generous Spaniard toward the superstition which has
eaten like a cancer into the bosom of his country. And
most unhappily for themselves and Spain, the men
whose heart and understanding revolted against intolerance
and imposture were themselves infected with the
counterpoison of French philosophy, and their best purposes
were too often sophisticated with the frothy notions
of that superficial school. This party, though far inferior
in numbers, took the lead, with the activity and zeal
of men who had embraced new opinions, and were
labouring to promote them. Though fatally erroneous
in what is of most importance, they acted in many cases
with a quick and ardent perception of what is just; and
not unfrequently they were right in the general principle,
even when they were wrong in its application.
Through their exertions, measures were carried, as far as
votes of the Cortes could effect them, which, if they had
been effectual, would have conferred lasting benefit upon
the people. But in many of these reforms they proceeded
rashly, neither sufficiently regarding the rights of
individuals, nor the opinions and habits of the nation;
and in what was most required at such a crisis both parties
were alike deficient. Instead of infusing into the
Government that energy which had been expected, the
Cortes weakened and embarrassed the executive by
perpetually intermeddling with it; so that, under their
control, the Regency which they had appointed became
more inefficient than the central Junta. And instead of
making the deliverance of the country their paramount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
object, they busied themselves in framing a constitution;
a work, which, if it had been more needful, might well
have been deferred till a more convenient season. Great
part of their sittings was consumed in metaphysical
discussions, arising out of the scheme of the constitution;
and the doctrine of the sovereignty of the people
was asserted in a temper which plainly manifested how
surely that sovereignty, if it were once erected, would
become unendurably tyrannical. Day after day these
abstractions were debated, while the enemy was besieging
Cadiz. Meantime no measures were adopted for
bringing the army into a better state; and the mournful
truth became apparent even to those who most reluctantly
acknowledged it. But if it be difficult to form an
effective army where there are none who have studied
the principles and profited by the practice of war, it is
yet more difficult to make legislators of men whose
minds are ill disciplined, even when well stored.</p>

<span class="subhead">AFFAIRS OF PORTUGAL. ROMANA’S DEATH. BADAJOZ TAKEN BY THE

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1810.</span><br />Expectations of the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Early</span> in November, the besiegers before Cadiz fired a
salute in honour of Massena’s triumphant entrance
into Lisbon. Such demonstrations could
not deceive the inhabitants of the Isle of Leon;
but might serve to depress the Spaniards, who had no
such means of information; and also to encourage the
French themselves, whose confidence in their fortune
had by this time received some abatement, and whose
hopes of bringing the contest to an end rested chiefly
now upon the success of the campaign in Portugal.
Massena had undertaken the conquest of that kingdom
in full expectation of outnumbering<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> any disciplined
force which could be opposed to him, and still more
certainly of outmanœuvring it; for the French Government
well knew with what misplaced parsimony the
military plans of the English were calculated; and
they had neither reckoned upon the skill of the British
general, nor the resolution of the British ministry, nor
the spirit and exertions of the Portugueze people. He
had been confirmed in this expectance by the cautious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
system which Lord Wellington had, through that parsimony,
been compelled to observe during the siege of
Ciudad Rodrigo: and though it was by an accident of
war that Almeida had fallen into his hands, the speedy
reduction of a place so important at that juncture increased
the habitual confidence of one who had been
accustomed to hear himself called the Child of Victory.
That presumption had received a lesson at Busaco, and
a check for which he was equally unprepared at the
lines of Torres Vedras. Could Lord Wellington have
spared a sufficient force to have occupied Santarem, as
well as Abrantes; or had the orders of the Portugueze
Regency for removing all provisions, been carried into
full effect in that part of the country, he must soon have
been compelled to retreat. The wonder, however, is
that so much devoted obedience was found to a measure,
as dreadful in its immediate consequences to the
persons upon whom it fell, as it was indispensable for
the deliverance of the country. But being allowed to
take a position which was not to be forced without a
greater expense of life than his antagonist could afford;
having found the means of present subsistence, and
possessing also that impassibility, ... that utter recklessness
of the sufferings which he inflicted, ... that perfect
destitution of humanity, ... which one of his fellow-marshals

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>See <span class="extlink">vol. ii</span>.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

had said was necessary for a commander
in this atrocious war, he was enabled to wait for
assistance, and for the chance of events.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gardanne enters Portugal, and marches back again.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>He had sent General Foy to give Buonaparte the
fullest account of his situation; and to supply
his wants till farther orders or effectual reinforcements
should be received, he ordered
General Gardanne, who commanded on the
Agueda, to escort a convoy of ammunition. Strong
reconnoitring parties were sent out frequently, both on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
the Coimbra and Castello Branco roads, in the hope of
meeting him; and one of these parties had at length the
mortification to ascertain that he had been within three
leagues of their advanced posts on the Zezere, and had
then turned back, a peasant having deceived him, by
declaring that the whole French army had withdrawn.
Whether the man acted thus upon the impulse of the
moment, or had been sent from Abrantes upon this
hazardous service, he succeeded in alarming men who,
from the want of other tidings, were prepared to believe
the worst. Gardanne’s corps consisted of 3000 men;
but they were so dispirited in their retreat, that when
Colonel Grant, with a handful of the Ordenanza, fired
upon them at Cardigos, they abandoned their convoy:
nor did this active officer desist from the pursuit, till
they had lost all their baggage and several hundred
men; thus reaching the frontier in a manner which had
every appearance, and all the consequences, of a precipitate
and forced retreat. The Comte d’Erlon, General
Drouet, who commanded the 9th corps, had meantime
arrived there; and he determined to enter Portugal, and
open a communication with Massena. Advancing, therefore,
with 10,000 men, he left some 8000 under General
Claparede, at Guarda, to drive away the Portugueze
force in his rear.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Drouet enters with 10,000 men.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Silveira commanded the force in that quarter: the
other divisions, under Brigadier-General Miller,
Colonels Wilson and Trant, shut in the line of
the Mondego to the confluence of the Alva.
Trant was in Coimbra, which he had recovered by a
movement as important in its effects upon the campaign,
as it was promptly conceived and ably executed. Wilson
had occupied the road from Ponte de Murcella to
Thomar, establishing himself at Cabaços; but when the
French had occupied Thomar, they attacked him twice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
from thence, and at length compelled him to fall back
upon Espinhal. This was precisely in the line of
Drouet’s march; and he was thus placed between two
fires, the enemy who had driven him from Cabaços
being now strongly posted there. He therefore collected
boats at Pena Cova, and crossed the Mondego,
timing this movement so critically, that the next day,
when the enemy had passed the Alva at Ponte de Murcella,
and occupied Foz d’Arouce and the neighbouring

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

villages, he re-crossed with a regiment
of militia and some cavalry at the same place, took post
the same evening at St. Andre, and captured some of
their marauders there in the act of pillage; being then
so near the invading force, that several of their stragglers
came dropping in during the night, thinking their
comrades were in possession of the place, and did not
discover their mistake till they were captured. Early
on the morrow he moved on Foz d’Arouce; Drouet’s
rear-guard had just quitted it; the village had been
sacked, and several of its inhabitants of both sexes were
lying dead in the streets, victims of those outrages and
cruelties which invariably marked the movements of the
French in Portugal. Wilson hung upon their flank and
rear; and, cutting off their stragglers and marauding
parties, which was all that could be done with so small
a force, made about an hundred prisoners. Trant also
marched from Coimbra with part of the garrison, in the
direction of Miranda de Corvo, to harass the enemy, if
he should take the Condeixa road; but Drouet, having
communicated with the party at Cabaços, who expected
his advance, halted at Espinhal, till he received instructions
from Massena to proceed with his corps and establish
himself at Leyria. Wilson then collected his
division, and closed upon his rear, for the purpose of
impeding him in that marauding system upon which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
whole army depended for subsistence. Their detached
parties were then brought in daily contact; a sort of
warfare in which the Portuguese were fully equal to
their invaders, and in which they had always the great
advantage of sure intelligence.</p>

<p>Claparede meantime had moved in the direction of
Lamego. Silveira, giving him the opportunity which
he sought, attacked his advanced guard at Ponte
d’Abbade, and was repulsed: having thus exposed the
comparative weakness of his force and his own

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rash operations of Silveira.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

want of skill, he was in his turn attacked at
Villar de Ponte, and made a precipitate retreat
upon Lamego: the enemy pursued him closely; and the
Portuguese, with an honourable feeling, when they evacuated
the city, carried with them 140 soldiers from the
hospital, on their backs; for they had no other means of
transport. Silveira then crossed the Douro. Lamego
was thus left to the invaders’ mercy, and Upper Beira
open to their inroads. In consequence of this rashness
on Silveira’s part, Miller and Wilson were ordered
toward the Doura by General Bacellar. Silveira, however,
had retreated with such precipitation, that neither
time nor opportunity was afforded for co-operating with
him; but Bacellar took a position on the Payva, on the
enemy’s left flank, and Wilson at Castrodayre, on their
rear. Claparede would willingly have pursued Silveira
beyond the Doura, that he might obtain the resources of
a province which had not been exhausted; but these
divisions were closing upon him, and menacing his communication
with Almeida. He returned, therefore, to
his position at Guarda.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conduct of Drouet’s corps.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But the country which Wilson had previously occupied
and protected was thus left open to Drouet’s
marauding parties; and no sooner was his removal
ascertained, than they were let loose, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
carried desolation along the banks of the Alva and to
the very heart of the Estella. No part of the country
suffered at this time more dreadfully than that which
was exposed to this corps: it was in vain that the miserable
inhabitants sought to conceal themselves in the
depths of the great pine forest which extends over so
large a portion of that sandy region; no recesses escaped
the search of men who were impelled by hunger, by
cruelty which seemed to have become in them a craving
and insatiable desire, and by a brutal appetite which
rendered them even more dreadful and more devilish
than their thirst for blood. The number of inhabitants
who perished in the diocese of Leyria (one of the smallest
in the kingdom) during the four months that the
French retained possession there, was ascertained by
official inquiries to be not less than 20,000: and a
great proportion of these were butchered in the <i>Pinhal</i>,
or died there of famine, and disease, and wretchedness.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1811.</span><br />The French army left to subsist upon the country.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>If Buonaparte had been in all other respects the hero,
the philanthropist, and the philosopher, which
he is represented to be by men whose understandings
seem to be as impenetrable as their
hearts, the history of this single campaign would nevertheless
stamp his character with indelible infamy.
Expecting, what indeed the event proved, that Lord
Wellington had not a force with which to act offensively
against Massena in the field, he calculated upon the
resources of Lisbon, and made no arrangement for supplying
the invading troops with provisions in case of
any unexpected obstacle to their immediate and complete
success. They were left as in Spain, to support
themselves how they could; and in the cruelties which
such a system inevitably occasioned, the evils of war received
their only possible aggravation. After the battle
of Busaco this army subsisted entirely upon what it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
could obtain by plunder. Throughout Portugal the
peasantry employ oxen for draught; these fell into the
enemy’s hands, wherever the orders of the Regency had
not been obeyed; and though those orders had met with
an obedience unexampled in its extent, from a devoted
people, yet there were many who, in hope that the
danger might be averted, delayed parting with what it
was ruin for them to lose; and thus the French obtained
a supply of cattle, which, though it would have been inconsiderable
for a British army, was not so for men in
whose way of preparing food nothing is wasted. But
the supply was not large; because kine are nowhere
numerous in that country, where there is little or no use
made of their milk, and little demand for their meat;
and it was not lasting, because want of bread occasioned
a consumption of animal food unusual among the French;
for wherever they went they found the ovens and the
mills destroyed. They bruised the corn and then boiled
it, and they roasted the maize, till with that alacrity and
cleverness which characterise the whole nation, they had
repaired the demolished mills, and in places where there
were none, constructed some of their own devising,
turned by an ass at the end of a lever, or by force of
arm. The hand-mills which soon afterwards made part
of their regimental equipments were an invention of
Marmont’s, suggested probably by the inconveniences
which Massena suffered at this time. If the ingenuity
with which they thus remedied one of their wants is
characteristic, the circumstance is not less so that finding
no other fit material for mill-stones they resorted to the
churches, and took for that purpose the slabs with which
the graves were covered, or the vaults closed!</p>

<p>At first, something like discipline was observed in the
marauding parties, and regular detachments with their
respective officers were sent on this degrading service;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
but it was found that these detachments brought home
little or nothing, while they who went forth without
orders and purveyed for themselves, returned driving
before them beasts well laden with the provisions they
had discovered; they were soon left, therefore, to take
their course, without the slightest attempt on the part of
the generals at regulation or restraint; and a system was
thus tolerated, ... not to say encouraged, ... in which it is
even more dreadful to reflect upon the depravity on one
side, than the unspeakable miseries which were endured
on the other. French writers who were themselves engaged
in this accursed expedition have told us that the
whole army had at times no other food than what was
obtained from hiding-places which the Portuguese who
fell into their hands had been made by torture to discover;
and that acts of this kind were as ordinary a
topic of conversation among the soldiers as any other incidents
of their campaign! In excuse for this, they observe,
and truly, that the army must otherwise have
perished, ... that they were like starving sailors, when as
the only means of prolonging their own lives they kill
and eat their comrades, in extremity of hunger. In
proportion as this apology, if such it may be called, be
valid, is the guilt of that tyrant by whose deliberate
orders the army was detained in such a situation; and
inferior only to his guilt is that of the commander by
whom such orders were obeyed. Life is what every
soldier must hold himself ready to lay down whenever
his military duty should require the sacrifice; but woe
to that soldier who acts as if life were all that he had to
lose!</p>

<p>The same writers, who by the plea of necessity excuse
a system so atrocious that even that plea cannot be admitted
without doubt as well as shuddering, tell us also
of supererogatory crimes committed by this army for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
which no motive but that of fiendish wickedness is
assignable, no palliation possible. When a family was
hunted out among the rocks, woods, or mountains by
these hell-hounds, happy were the men who did not
endure torments, the women who did not suffer violation,
before they were murdered. The French officers,
when any of them were made prisoners, endeavoured
always to reject the opprobrium of these flagitious and
undeniable deeds upon the Italians and Germans in their
army: but let us be just to human nature, which has
neither made the Italians and Germans more depraved
than the French, nor the French than the English. The
Italians, indeed, having grown up in a country where
great crimes are notoriously committed with impunity,
may have been accustomed to regard such crimes with
less repugnance than either the Germans or the French.
But French discipline had made all in its armies of
whatever stock good soldiers: the first thing needful for
moral improvement is to bring men under obedience,
which is the root of civil virtue: military discipline had
done this; had moral discipline been connected with it
as it might and ought to have been, they who were made
good soldiers, if they had not by the same process been
made good men, would have been withheld from any
open wickedness. But this was systematically disregarded
in Buonaparte’s armies; the more thoroughly
his servants had corrupted their feelings and hardened
their hearts, the better were they fitted for the work in
which they were to be employed. Under like circumstances,
British soldiers might have been equally wicked;
but no British Government has ever been so iniquitous
as to place its soldiers in such circumstances. The only
offence deemed worthy of punishment in Massena’s army
was insubordination towards a superior. A wretch
might sometimes be apprehended in an act of atrocity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
so flagrant that it was not possible to let him escape;
but there was no attempt to prevent such horrors, not
even when there was the wish: they were known and
suffered, ... by better minds in despair, by others with
unconcern. In such an army, the soldiers who brought
young and handsome women to the camp, as part of
their booty, were considered as humane; and humane
by comparison they were, though these women, ... whatever
their former condition had been, ... were played for
as a stake at cards, were bartered for provisions or
horses, and were put up publicly to sale! It is related,
that such women as survived the first horrors of their
situation became reconciled to it, because of the terror
in which they had previously lived, and because their
lives were now secure; that they attached themselves to
those who became, as it is called, their protectors; and
that it was no uncommon thing for a woman to pass
from one such protector to another, rising a step at
every exchange, till she became at last the mistress of a
general!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Skill of the marauders.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The skill which some of these marauders acquired in
their search for food, resembled the sagacity
with which savages track their prey. That
they should detect with unerring certainty any place of
concealment in a dwelling or an out-house, might have
been expected from the habits of plunder which they
had been indulged in in former campaigns; but when
they were questing in woods, or among rocks, or in the
open country, a new sense seemed to be developed in
them. There were men in every company who could
discover a depôt of provisions by scent far off. Such
resources, however, could ill suffice for such an army;
and the reinforcements which they received bringing
with them no supplies, added as much to their difficulties
as to their strength. Wine, which was found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
in abundance at first, was lavishly consumed while it
lasted. Bread failed entirely; and in many corps the
rations of maize were reduced first to a half, then to a
third. A third of the whole army was at last employed
in thus purveying from a wasted country, and their comrades
are described as stationing videttes to watch for
their coming, and communicate by signals the joyful intelligence
if they came with supplies; for little now was
brought back by the most successful marauders, and
sometimes the whole produce of such an excursion was
consumed before they returned to their quarters. They
had found when they entered the kingdom whole towns
and villages deserted at their approach; more appalling
spectacles were presented now in the recesses to which
they penetrated; whole families were seen there lying
dead; or in a state worse than death: and those who
were not suffering from famine or disease seemed to be
bewildered in mind as well as rendered wild in appearance,
by perpetual terror and exposure.</p>

<p>The helpless and the most devoted were they who
suffered thus, ... old men, women, and children; and
they who remaining to protect wives, children, sisters,
and parents, or to perish with them, forewent for the
performance of that duty the pursuit of vengeance.
Meantime, the greater part of the effective population
were actively employed. Everywhere in the rear of the
enemy parties of the militia and ordenanza were on the
alert: and when General Foy, returning from Paris,
entered Portugal with an escort of 3000 men to rejoin
the invading army, Lieutenant-Colonel Grant, with
eighty of the ordenanza, took possession of a height
which commanded a pass near the village of Enxabarda,
and kept up a fire upon them for two hours, as long as
daylight served. Above 200 of their dead were counted
within the distance of four leagues, the inclemency of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
the weather having killed many of the wounded. The
invaders were not prepared to encounter such severe
cold as is sometimes felt among these mountains. About
three hundred men of Drouet’s corps were frozen to

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Feldzug von Portugal, p. 66.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

death during a night march between Castello
Branco and Thomar. There was a peasant
belonging to the latter district of great bodily
strength, and answerable hardihood, who, being deprived
of his former peaceful occupations, took up in its stead
that of destroying Frenchmen, that he might live by
spoiling them as they did by spoiling others; this man
is said to have killed more than thirty of the enemy,
during the month of February, with his own hand, and
to have recovered from them about fifty horses and
mules, which, with other booty, he carried to Abrantes
for sale. He continued to carry on this single-handed
war as long as they remained in the country; and became
so well known by his exploits that the French set
a large price upon his head; but he was in no danger of
being betrayed by his countrymen, and too wary to be
entrapped. A cave in the mountains was his usual
abode. Some of the wretched inhabitants from the adjacent
parts took refuge near him, and felt themselves
comparatively secure under his protection.</p>

<p>Small parties from Abrantes cut off some 300 of the
enemy during the two first months of the year. In one
of these desultory affairs, which were all that occurred,
while the two armies were waiting anxiously, each with
its own views, Captain Fenwick, a most enterprising
young officer, who commanded at Obidos, and had been
engaged more than twenty times with the French foraging
parties, received a mortal wound near Alcobaça: he
was pursuing with some Portugueze recruits a party of
fourscore French, when one of them, as he was within a
few yards, turned round and shot him through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
body. He had so won the confidence and good will of
the peasantry, many of whom he had armed with
French musquets, that they not only brought him the
best information, but were ready under his command to
face any danger. No man could have been more regretted
for the excellent military qualities which he had
displayed, and the expectations which were formed of
him. The only other affair deserving of notice occurred
at Rio Mayor. General Junot made a reconnoisance
thither from Alcanhede in considerable force, having
learned that there were stores of wine and corn in the
town. The piquet which was stationed there retired.
Junot rashly galloped into the town, and a soldier of the
German hussars waited for him and brought him down.
But though this robber left some of his blood upon that
earth which had long been crying for it, the wound was
not fatal, the ball having lodged between the nose and
the cheek bone. A box of topazes which he designed as
a present for Marie Louise, was intercepted by a party of
the Spanish army in Extremadura, who with rare
disinterestedness, foregoing all right to the prize, delivered
it to the government. There were seventy-three
stones, valued at 3250 dollars: as it was not possible in
such times to discover from what churches or what family
they had been plundered, the Spanish government disposed
of them by raffle, and appropriated the produce to
the relief of faithful Spaniards in the province of Burgos
and La Mancha.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Massena perseveres in remaining, against Ney’s advice.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Had Ney’s advice been followed, the French, as soon
as they had ascertained that it was hopeless to
attack the lines of Torres Vedras, would have
retreated immediately to the frontier. Well
had it been for the credit of that army, and well
for humanity, if this counsel had been taken. But he
and Massena were upon ill terms; Massena, by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
defence of Genoa, had acquired a character for endurance
which was supposed to influence him at this time and
Buonaparte, in whose calculations human sufferings
were never regarded, undoubtedly expected that there
would be a change of ministry in England, and that the
first measure of the Whigs when in power would be to
withdraw the army from Portugal and leave Lisbon open
to him. That party deceived him by their hopes as
much as they deceived themselves; and they in return
were duped by the falsehoods which the French Government
published for the purpose of deluding the French
people. The only statements which were allowed to be
made public in France admitted, indeed, that the English
force, and still more the nature of the ground, rendered
the lines of Torres Vedras a strong position; but they
affirmed that within those lines there was so severe a
famine, that people lay dead and dying in the streets of
Lisbon, while the French in their quarters were abundantly
supplied. But at this very time it was felt by
the invading army as no slight aggravation of their
sufferings, that while they were in want of every thing,
there was plenty beyond that near demarcation which
they were unable to force, with all their courage and
their excellent skill in war. Throughout the tract
which they occupied, the towns of Torres Novas and
Thomar were the only places where the inhabitants had
generally remained in their houses; but now, when they
who had erroneously chosen this as the least of two evils
found that the food was taken from them and their

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of the people within the lines.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

children, they began to retire within the British
lines, ... almost in a starving state. Lisbon, notwithstanding
the great military force which it
then had to support, and though 200,000 fugitives had
taken shelter there, was constantly and plentifully supplied;
and the distress for food which was felt there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
arose only from want of means wherewith to purchase
what was in the market. This was relieved by the Government
and by the religious houses, who in feeding
the poor at this time rendered unequivocal service to the
community. Private charity also was never more nobly
manifested than in this exigency; among the British
officers, a weekly subscription was regularly raised in aid
of the destitute; and it is believed that not less than
80,000 of the persons thus suddenly thrown upon the
mercy of their fellow-creatures were housed, fed, and
clothed at the private cost of those who in their own
circumstances had very materially suffered from the
interruption which the war had occasioned to their trade,
from the pressure of war taxes, and of other requisitions
rendered necessary by the exigencies of a state which
was struggling for existence. There had been more
danger from disease than from dearth, for no sooner had
the army retreated upon the lines than the military
hospitals were filled, and various other public and private
buildings in or near the capital, which were appropriated
to the same use. The hospital stores of every kind had
been consumed, or carried off by Junot’s army, and had
not yet been re-supplied. Recourse was immediately
had to the benevolent feelings of the people, and clothing
and other things needful for the sick were liberally
contributed. But during the time that the armies remained
in their respective positions, the fever in the
hospitals proved more destructive than the sword of the
enemy. Meantime the condition of the Portugueze who
remained without the lines, though within the protection
of the allies, became every day more dreadful; they
were not within reach of that eleemosynary distribution
by which their less miserable countrymen were supported;
any thing which the country could afford was
only to be obtained by rescuing it from the enemy, or by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
marauding in those parts which were open to his ravages;
and when the men of the family perished in this
pursuit, or were rendered by over-exertion and disease
incapable of following it, there was no other resource for
the women and children and the men thus rendered
helpless, than the scanty aid which the troops stationed
there could bestow. The British officers at Caldas da
Rainha formed a hospital for these unhappy persons,
anxiety and inanition having produced a fever: in that
little, but then crowded town, the average of burials was
from twenty-five to thirty a day: a trench was dug, and
the dead laid along the side of it, till a Priest came once
a day, and with one funeral service consigned them to
the common grave. Orphaned children were wandering
about with none to care for them, or give them food: and
frightful as the mortality was, it would have been far
greater but for a distribution of soup and maize bread,
made once a day by the British officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>False statements in France.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was also asserted in France that the discontent of
the Portugueze, under the privations which
their allies compelled them to endure, was at its
height; that Marshal Beresford had ordered
every inhabitant to be shot without process, who did not
abandon his house upon the enemy’s approach; that
Trant and Silveira had been destroyed; and that not a
day passed in which English deserters did not come
over. Germans and Portugueze, it was said, were not
accounted deserters, because they only returned to their
duty in joining the army of Napoleon. Such representations
obtained more credit among factious Englishmen
than in France, and Massena looked with far less hope
to the result of his operation than was expressed by
these despondents. With that confident ignorance which
always characterised their speculations, they gave him
an additional army of more than 20,000 men, which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
to join him under Bessieres, and they called Sebastiani
from Malaga to co-operate in the united attack. “The
whole effort,” said they, “will be directed against Lord
Wellington: the whole force is collecting and marching
to the different points of attack, with the knowledge of
the allies, but without their having any means of warding
off the blow. The battle must be fought at the
time, and in the way we have always foretold: and he
must have firm nerves who can contemplate the probable
issue with composure.” “The crisis in Portugal,”
said another self-constituted director of public
opinion, “may now be expected daily; and then let the
calumniators of Sir John Moore do justice to the memory
of that injured officer, who was goaded to commit
his errors, and then abused for being defeated! He had
not interest enough to have his errors christened exploits,
and his flight victory.” Another demagogue,
after representing that it was England which caused the
calamities of Portugal, and the English, whom the Portugueze
ought to hate and execrate as the authors of
their sufferings, asked triumphantly, “Who is there
mad enough to expect that we shall be able to put the
French out of the Peninsula, either by arms, or by negotiation?
Where is the man, in his senses, who believes,
or will say that he believes, that we shall be able
to accomplish this? Suppose peace were to become the
subject of discussion, does any one believe that Napoleon
would enter into negotiations about Spain and Portugal?
Does any one believe that we must not leave
them to their fate? This is bringing the matter to the
test. And if the reader is persuaded that we should not
be able to stipulate for the independence of the Peninsula,
the question is settled, and the result of the war is in
reality ascertained!”</p>

<p>An immediate retreat, such as Ney advised, would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
have been attended with a loss of reputation, which if
Massena had been willing to incur, would have been ill

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Schemes of co-operation from the side of Andalusia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

brooked by Buonaparte. But in the position
which the French had taken, if they could by
any means subsist there, they might look for assistance
from Soult, and so waiting, facilitate his
operations, by occupying the chief attention of the
British army. The Spaniards had nowhere displayed so
little spirit as in Andalusia. The people of Cadiz, contented
with the security for which they were beholden
to their situation, seemed not inclined to make any effort
against their besiegers; Soult, therefore, might spare
a sufficient force for besieging Badajoz. His means for
the siege were ample, and the place must fall unless it
were relieved by an army capable of meeting the besiegers
in the field; but such a force could be drawn
only from the lines of Torres Vedras. If the allies were
thus weakened, their position might be attacked; or
should this still be thought too hazardous, the passage
of the Tagus might probably be effected. This would
put great part of Alemtejo in their power, and open the
communication with Seville and Madrid. If, on the
other hand, Badajoz were suffered to fall without an
attempt at relieving it, the same advantage would follow
from the advance of the victorious army. Masters of
Badajoz, and the other less important fortresses, they
might leave Elvas behind them; and if they could win
the heights opposite Lisbon, they might from thence
bombard the capital and destroy the shipping. With
these views, Massena made preparations for crossing the
Tagus. The British troops which were detached to the
south bank, for the purpose of defeating this intention,
were cantoned in the villages there, and suffered very
much from ague in that low and unwholesome country.
Opposite Santarem the river is sometimes fordable; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
once the enemy took possession of an island, called Ilha
dos Ingleses, whence they carried off a guard of the
ordenanza, and some cattle. The possession of this
islet might have greatly facilitated their passage, but
they were speedily dislodged by a company of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">January.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the 34th, which remained there for that time.
To provide, however, against the possibility of their
effecting this movement, and also against the advance of
a force from the Alentejo frontier, measures had been
taken for fortifying a line from the Tagus opposite
Lisbon to Setubal; orders were issued for clearing and
evacuating the country on their approach; and the inhabitants
(well knowing by Loison’s campaign what
atrocities were to be expected from such invaders) were
required to retire within this line.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Olivença taken by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Soult and Mortier accordingly, as had been foreseen,
advanced from Seville in the latter end of December.
Ballasteros, with his ill-equipped and
ill-disciplined, but indefatigable troops, was
driven out of the field; and Mendizabal, who, with
6000 foot and 2500 Portugueze and Spanish cavalry,
had advanced to Llerena, and forced Girard to retire
from thence, was now himself compelled to fall back
upon Almendralejo and Merida, and finally upon Badajoz,
throwing 3000 men into Olivença, a place which
had been of great importance in the Acclamation and
Succession wars, but which it would at this time have
been more prudent to dismantle than to defend. Taking
immediate advantage of this error, Soult sent Girard
against it with the artillery of the advanced guard. The
trenches were opened on the 12th of January. The commander,
Don Manuel Herk, communicated with Mendizabal
on the 21st, assuring him of his determination and
ability to hold out: but a division of besieging artillery
had arrived; it was planted in battery that night; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
in the morning as soon as it opened, Herk surrendered
at discretion. Mortier then immediately invested Badajoz.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Badajoz invested.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The city of Badajoz, which in the age of Moorish
anarchy was sometimes the capital of a short-lived
kingdom, stands on the left bank of the
Guadiana, near to the spot where it receives the Gevora,
and about a league from the little river Caya, which on
that part of the frontier divides Spain from Portugal.
Its population before the war was estimated at 16,000.
Elvas is in sight, at the distance of twelve miles, standing
on higher ground, and in a healthier as well as
stronger situation; for endemic diseases prevail at certain
seasons in the low grounds upon the Guadiana.
Count La Lippe had made Elvas one of the strongest
fortifications in Europe. Badajoz is a place of the third
order; it has no advantage of natural strength, like its
old rival; but it had been well fortified, and was protected
by two strong forts, S. Christoval on the west, and
Las Pardaleras on the east. The acquisition of this city
was of the utmost importance to the enemy; if Massena
could keep his ground till it fell, a communication would
be opened for him with Andalusia; Mortier’s army
would be enabled to co-operate with him and act against
Abrantes; and against Lisbon itself, unless the Transtagan
lines, which were in progress, should be as formidable
as those of Torres Vedras: and supplies might
then be drawn from Alentejo, the western part of that
province being a rich corn country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Death of Romana.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lord Wellington had concerted his plans for the defence
of this important frontier with Romana;
and a position behind the Gevora had been fixed
on for keeping open a communication with Badajoz.
Romana’s army re-crossed the Tagus, and began their
march thither; British troops were to follow, as soon as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
the reinforcements should arrive, which westerly winds,
unusually prevalent at that season, had long delayed;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 23.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and Romana had named the following day for
his own departure, when he was cut off by
sudden<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> death, occasioned by ossification about the
heart. Due honours were paid to his remains by the
Portugueze Government, as well as by the British army:
his bowels were buried close to the high altar at Belem,
the burial-place of the Portugueze kings, during the
most splendid age of their history: his heart and body
were sent to his native place, Majorca; and a monument
was voted to him by the Cortes. Castaños was appointed
to succeed him, and sailed from Cadiz for Lisbon
accordingly; but before he could arrive, the consequences
of Romana’s death had been severely felt.
Under the most difficult and hopeless circumstances
that noble Spaniard had still kept his army in the field,
and had repeatedly annoyed the enemy and obstructed
their measures, without ever exposing himself

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Feb. 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to any considerable loss. The troops, therefore,
had full confidence in him; but when Mendizabal
met them at Elvas, and took the command, they had no
such reliance upon their new leader. On the same day
the Portugueze cavalry, under General Madden, drove
the French beyond the Gevora; but being unsupported,
they were driven back with some loss by General Latour
Maubourg, and the whole force then entered, some into
Badajoz, some into Fort Christoval. On the morrow a
sortie was made, with more gallantry than good fortune,
and with the loss of eighty-five officers, and 500 men
killed and wounded: Don Carlos d’España was among
the latter. The courage of the men in this sally was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
not more remarkable than the total want of arrangement
in their leaders: when they had won the first battery
they could not disable the guns, because they had forgotten
to take spikes with them! Not discouraged by
this severe loss, the troops came out on the 9th. The
enemy’s cavalry retired before them across the Gevora,
and they took up their intended position on the heights
of S. Christoval, between the Gevora, the Caya, and the
Guadiana. From thence Mendizabal communicated
with Elvas and Campo Mayor, and there he fancied
himself in perfect security. The position, indeed, was
strong, and while it was held, Badajoz could not be
taken. Lord Wellington had advised Romana to occupy
it, but he had advised him to intrench it also,
and the necessity of so doing had been repeatedly

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Destruction of his army.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

represented to Mendizabal in vain. Well understanding
with what an antagonist he had to
deal, Mortier would instantly have attacked him if the
Gevora and Guadiana had not at this time overflowed
their banks. Losing, however, no time in his operations,
he carried Las Pardaleras by assault on the night of the
11th. On the 18th all things were ready for the passage
of the Guadiana, and a few shells from a well-planted
howitzer had the effect of making Mendizabal remove his
whole army out of the protection of the fort. Thus he
abandoned the main advantage of his position, and yet
took no other precaution against an attack than that of
destroying a bridge over the Gevora; but soldiers
seldom fail to know when they are ill commanded, and
Romana’s men now deserted in troops, rather than be
exposed to the certain destruction which they foresaw.
That very night Mortier threw a flying bridge over the
Guadiana, forded the Gevora where it was waist-deep,
and surprised Mendizabal on the heights. The camp
was taken standing, with all the baggage and artillery:<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
the cavalry fled, notwithstanding the efforts of their
officers to rally them; 850 men were killed; more than
5000 taken; some escaped into the city; some, with
better fortune, into Elvas; the rest dispersed. The loss
of the French, in killed and wounded, was only 170; so
cheaply was this important success obtained.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Governor of Badajoz killed.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This was the first consequence of Romana’s death;
far worse were to ensue. Relieved from all inquietude
on that side, Mortier now pressed the
siege; and yet not with that full confidence of
success which the consciousness of his own strength and
adequate preparations might else have given him, because
he knew that the governor, Don Rafael Menacho,
intended to have emulated Zaragoza in the defence
which he should make. This governor was killed
upon the walls by a cannon ball, when the garrison
were making their last sortie to prevent the covered

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Imaz appointed to succeed him.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

way from being crowned. Don José de Imaz
succeeded to the command: he was an officer
of reputation, who had escaped with the troops
from Denmark, had shared their sufferings under Blake,
borne a part in their victory under the Duque del Parque,
and followed their fortunes through evil and good till the
present time.</p>

<p>In the official accounts of the French it was said that
the English, according to their custom, had remained
tranquil spectators of the destruction of their allies.
They had, indeed, been so in the early part of the campaign,
to the bitter mortification of the army and of the
general, who, by the half measures of his Government,
was placed in this most painful situation. The ill effects
of the Walcheren expedition were felt more in the timid
temporizing policy which ensued, than in the direct loss,
lamentable as that had been; for the ministry having
spent then where they ought to have spared, spared now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
where they ought to have spent. Just views, right
feeling, and public opinion (which in these days is,
whether right or wrong, more powerful with a British
ministry than any or all other considerations) made them
continue the contest; while secret apprehension of ill
success, insensibly produced by the constant language
of their opponents, who spoke with more than oracular
confidence of defeat and total failure as the only possible
event, withheld them from prosecuting it with vigour.
They considered always what was the smallest force with
which Lord Wellington could maintain his ground, never
entrusting him with one that might render success calculable,
and not yet venturing to believe that British
courage would render it not less certain by land than it
was by sea. Some excuse for this weak policy, which
even to themselves needed excuse, they found in the
prepossessions of the king, who, although upon some
points of the highest importance he took clearer and
juster views than the ablest of his ministers, could
never in his latter days be brought to contemplate
war upon the enlarged scale which the French Revolution
had introduced; but looked upon an army of 20,000
men to be as great a force as it had been in the early
part of his reign. Against this prepossession the ministers
had always to contend while the king was capable
of business; and when his fatal malady removed that
impediment, Marquis Wellesley could not yet persuade
his colleagues that the parsimony which protracts a war
is more expensive than the liberal outlay which enables
a general to prosecute it with vigour, and thereby bring
it to a successful end.</p>

<p>Had Lord Wellington found a reinforcement of 10,000
men when he fell back upon his lines, Massena, being
entirely without provisions at that time, must have retreated
as precipitately as Soult had done from Porto.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
That they were not attacked before they took up a
position for the winter, and that no operations against
them were undertaken while they remained there, the
French imputed either to want of enterprise, or want of
skill in the British commander, undervaluing both, as
much as they overrated the force at his disposal. But
though they were thus unjust in their censures of Lord
Wellington, the imputation which they cast upon the
British Government had been to all appearance justified
up to this time, except in the case of Badajoz, on which
occasion it was now made. Nothing but the grossest
negligence and incapacity on his own part could have
exposed Mendizabal to the total discomfiture which had
befallen him. After the loss of his army it was impossible
for Lord Wellington to detach a force sufficient
for raising the siege, while Massena continued in his
position; but it was of such importance to preserve
Badajoz, that the British general determined to attack
him, strongly as he was posted, as soon as the long-looked
for reinforcements should arrive. But the opportunity
which both generals at this time desired
of thus deciding the issue of the invasion was not
afforded them: the winds continued to disappoint Lord
Wellington in his expectations of succour; and no
patience on the part of the French could enable them
longer to endure the privations to which the system of
their wicked Government had exposed them. They
consoled themselves under those privations by thinking
that no English army could have supported them; for
that the sufferings which they had borne patiently would
have driven Englishmen to desert. But their endurance
had been forced now to its utmost extent. Reports were
current, that if Massena would not engage in some decisive
operations, which might deliver them from their
sufferings, he should be set aside, and Ney, in whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
intrepidity they had the fullest confidence, be called
upon to command them. That degree of distress had
been reached at which discipline itself, even in the most
intelligent army, gives way; and the men, when nothing
was left of which to plunder the inhabitants, began to
plunder from each other, without regard of rank, the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Feldzug von Portugal, 30.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

stronger from the weaker. Massena, therefore,
was compelled, while it was yet possible to
secure supplies for the march, to determine
upon retreating to that frontier which he had passed
with such boastful anticipations of triumph.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French begin their retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first information of his purpose came through a
channel which was entitled to so little credit,
that it seems to have obtained none. On the
evening of the first of March, a Portugueze boy
was apprehended in Abrantes with articles of provision,
which were with reason suspected to be for an enemy,
because the boy was not ready with an answer when he
was asked for whom he was catering. Being carried
before the governor, he confessed that he was servant to
the commanding officer of a French regiment, who had
sent him to purchase these things, because the army was
about to return to the north of Portugal. The next day,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

he added, Massena would review the troops on
the south of the Zezere, and the retreat would
commence on the evening of the fifth. That a boy in
such a situation should have acquired this knowledge, is
a remarkable proof of his sagacity, and of the indiscretion
of the officer from whom he must have obtained
it; for it was verified in all its parts.</p>

<p>Such a movement was, however, so probable, that it
had for some days been expected. The first apparent
indication of it was given by the French setting fire
to their workshops, stores, and bridge-materials at Punhete,
on the 3rd. They had previously been sending the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
heavy artillery, the baggage, and the sick to the rear.
On the 4th, transports with 7000 British troops on board
anchored in the Tagus; and that same day the enemy’s
advanced corps withdrew from Santarem. Lieutenant
Claxton, who commanded the gun-boats appointed to
co-operate with the troops in Alentejo, saw them departing,
as he was reconnoitring under that city. No time
was lost in occupying it by the allies; and when it was
seen how the natural advantages of that position had
been improved by all the resources of military skill,
Lord Wellington’s prudence in waiting till time and
hunger had done his work was acknowledged by those
who before had been inclined to censure him for inactivity
and want of enterprise. The opportunity which
he had so long desired, and so anxiously expected, had
now arrived; and in the sure confidence of intellectual
power, he saw that the deliverance of the Peninsula
might be secured in that campaign, if Badajoz were
defended as it might and ought to be. No sooner,
therefore, had it been ascertained that the enemy was retreating,
than he despatched the intelligence to Elvas,
desiring the commander to communicate it to the
governor of Badajoz, assuring him that he should
speedily be succoured, and urging him, in reliance
upon that assurance, to defend the fortress to the last
extremity. That intelligence was despatched on the
6th. General Imaz received it on the 9th. The next
day a breach was made, and Mortier summoned him

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Badajoz surrendered.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to surrender. The garrison at this time consisted
of 7500 effective men: the townsmen
might have been made effective also; provisions
and ammunition were in abundance; and the
intelligence which Lord Wellington received from thence
on the very day that Massena’s retreat was made known
to Imaz, was, that the place might probably hold out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
month; so well was it stored, so ably garrisoned, and so
little injury had it received. The general, however, like
every man who, in such a situation, is inclined to act a
dishonourable part, called a council of war. The director
of engineers delivered it as his opinion, that 5000 men
would be required to resist an assault, and that then the
surrender could only be delayed two or three days: if
there was an evident probability of being succoured in
that time, it would be their duty to hold out, though it
should be to the last man; without such a probability,
no farther sacrifice ought to be made. Twelve officers
voted with him; one of them qualifying his vote with
the condition, that unless the garrison were permitted to
march out by the breach, and incorporate themselves
with the nearest Spanish army, no terms should be accepted.
Imaz delivered his opinion in these words:
“Notwithstanding that our second line of defence is not
formed; that we have very few guns in the batteries of
Santiago, St. José, and St. Juan, and no support for
withstanding the assault, I am of opinion that, by force
of valour and constancy, the place be defended till
death.” In this he was followed by General Don Juan
José Garcia. The commandant of artillery, Don Joaquin
Caamaño, gave his vote for holding out in very different
terms, and with as different a spirit. “The enemy,”
said he, “not having silenced the fire of the place, the
flanks which command the ascent of the breach being in
a state of defence, the breach being mined, the pitch
barrels ready, and the entrance covered by the parapet
which we formed during the night, I think we ought to
stand an assault; or make our way out to join the
nearest corps, or the neighbouring forts.” This opinion,
which did not, like that of the governor, invalidate itself,
was followed by Camp-Marshal Don Juan Mancio. It
is due to those who did their duty thus to particularise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
their names. In the votes of an unworthy majority Imaz
found all he wanted; and even in their excuse, it must
be remembered that this traitorous governor did not
inform them of Massena’s retreat, and the assurance
which he had received of certain and speedy relief.
Romana, whose fear of democracy made him everywhere
at variance with the popular authorities, had
ordered the Junta of Extremadura to leave Badajoz,
and retire to Valencia de Alcantara. That Junta had
distinguished itself by its activity and zeal, and had its
members not been thus imprudently expelled, they
might have given to the defence of the city that civic
character which had formed the strength of Zaragoza,
and Gerona, and Ciudad Rodrigo; and which, in this
instance, would have proved the salvation, as well as
the glory of the fortress.</p>

<p>On the eleventh of March, therefore, the garrison
laid down their arms, and were made prisoners of war.
The empty stipulation that they should march out by
the breach was granted, curiously, as it proved, to the
disgrace of those who proposed it, ... for so insignificant
was this breach that some time was employed in enlarging
it, to render it practicable for their passage!
“Thus,” in Lord Wellington’s words, “Olivença and
Badajoz were given up without any sufficient cause;
while Marshal Soult, with a corps of troops which never
was supposed to exceed 20,000 men, besides capturing
these two places, made prisoners and destroyed above
22,000 Spanish troops!” 17,500 were marched as prisoners
of war to France! Mortier, in his dispatches,
endeavoured to gloze over the conduct of General Imaz.
“The death of Menacho,” he said, “had possibly contributed
to protract the siege for some days; for his successor
wished to give some proof of his talents, and
thereby occasioned a longer resistance.” This could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
deceive no one. The Regency, when they communicated
to the Cortes Mendizabal’s official account of the
fall of the place, informed them that they were not
satisfied with the conduct of Imaz, and had given the
commander-in-chief orders to institute an enquiry.
But the surrender of the city was not the only part of
these unhappy transactions which required investigation;
and Riesco proposed that rigorous enquiry should
also be made concerning the action of the 19th of
February, and the consequent dispersion of Mendizabal’s
army, in order that condign punishment might be
inflicted on those who were found culpable. “The loss
of Badajoz,” he said, “was a calamity of the greatest
importance at this time: it facilitated to the enemy a
free communication with Castille and Andalusia, gave
them an entrance into Alentejo, and means for besieging
Elvas: it would also enable them to support Massena;
so that this fatal calamity might draw after it the conquest
of Portugal.” Calatrava proposed that it should
also be explained why so considerable a division had
been shut up in Olivença, and no attempt made to
succour it. “My melancholy predictions concerning
Extremadura,” said he, “have been verified. The
chiefs of the army of the left, instead of defending that
province and preserving the capital, have at length
ended in losing army, province, and capital. Well, indeed,
may it be wondered at, that the governor, after
having himself voted for continuing the defence, should
immediately have capitulated, without sustaining an
assault, ... a contradiction which can no otherwise be
explained, than by supposing that the vote was given
insincerely.” He concluded by proposing, that notwithstanding
the conduct of the governor, the Cortes
should make honourable mention of the heroic inhabitants
of that place, and the brave garrison. Del Monte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
said, it had been remarked on this occasion, that the loss
of a battle was followed always by the surrender of a
place besieged. This, he properly observed, was a
position not less perilous to get abroad, than it was false
in itself.... Another member, with indignant feeling,
demanded, that when the capitulation of Badajoz, and
the votes of the council of war were published, there
should be added to them a statement of the situation of
Gerona when that city was surrendered. “At Badajoz,”
said he, “nothing has been alleged for surrendering, but
that there was an open breach; nothing was said of
want ... nothing of sickness, nor of any one of those
causes which might have justified the surrender. Let
then the soldiers and the nation contrast with this the
conduct of Gerona! Months before that city was yielded,
there was not merely an open breach, but the walls
were destroyed; ... the scarcity was such, that boiled
wheat was sometimes the only food; and for the sick, a
morsel of ass-flesh, when it could be had. In this state
the governor of Gerona ordered, that no man, on pain of
death, should speak of capitulation. By this path did
they make their way to glory and immortality! The
soldier who would step beyond the common sphere has
here what to imitate. If Badajoz had resisted only four
days longer, it would have been relieved.”</p>

<p>This was a cutting reflection. But though the loss
of that city led to consequences grievously injurious to
the allies, and to a dreadful cost of lives, it did not produce
all the evil which Riesco apprehended; and that its
evil effects did not extend thus far, was owing to the
spirit of the Portugueze people, who, unlike General
Imaz and his companions in infamy, had discharged their
duty to the utmost. Treachery, which had done much
for France in other countries, had not been found in
Portugal; and popular feeling, which had done more,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
was there directed with all the vehemence of vindictive
justice against the most unprovoked, the most perfidious,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Skill and barbarity of the French in their retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and the most inhuman of invaders. But Massena’s
military talents had never been more eminently
shown, and nothing could exceed the skill which
was now manifested in all his dispositions. His
columns moved by angular lines converging to
a point, upon gaining which they formed in mass, and
then continued their retreat, Ney with the flower of the
army covering the rear, while Massena so directed the
march of the main body, as to be always ready to protect
the rear guard, which whenever it was hardly
pressed fell back, and brought its pursuers with it upon
the main army, waiting in the most favourable position
to receive them. This praise is due to M. Massena and
his generals, and the troops which they commanded: but
never did any general or any army insure such everlasting
infamy to themselves by their outrages and abominations,
committed during the whole of their tarriance
in Portugal, and continued during their retreat. Lord
Wellington said, their conduct was marked by a barbarity
seldom equalled, and never surpassed: all circumstances
considered, he might have said it had never
been paralleled. For these things were not done in dark
ages, nor in uncivilised countries, nor by barbarous
hordes, like the armies of Timour or Nadir Shah; it was
in Europe, and in the nineteenth century, that these
atrocities were committed by the soldiers of the most
cultivated and most enlightened part of Europe, mostly
French, but in no small proportion Germans and
Netherlanders. Nor was the French army, like our
own, raised and recruited from the worst members of
society, who enter the service in an hour of drunkenness,
or of necessity, or despair: the conscription
brought into its ranks men of a better description, both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
as to their parentage, their breeding, and their prospects
in life; insomuch, that the great majority are truly
described as sober, orderly, intelligent, and more or less
educated. Nor is it to be believed, that, although they
acted like monsters of wickedness in this campaign,
they were in any degree worse than other men by
nature: on the contrary, the national character of the
French, Germans, and Netherlanders, authorises a presumption
that they were inclined to be, and would have
been good and useful members of society, if the service
in which they were compulsorily engaged had not made
them children of perdition. How nefarious, then, must
have been the system of that Government which deliberately
placed its armies in circumstances where this
depravation was inevitably produced!... how deserving
of everlasting infamy the individual by whose absolute
will that Government was directed!... and how deep the
guilt of those who were the willing and active agents of
such a Government, ... the devoted servants of such a
ruler! No equitable reader will suppose that any
national reproach is intended in thus dwelling upon the
crimes which were committed throughout the Peninsular
war by the French and their allies: Englishmen
under like circumstances would have been equally depraved:
the reproach is not upon a brave and noble
nation; it rests upon those alone on whom the guilt
abides; and as we tender the welfare and improvement
of the human race, let us hope that it may be perpetual!</p>

<p>The retreat of this abominable army was marked by
havoc, conflagration, and cruelties of every kind. The
towns of Torres Novas, Thomar, and Pernes, with the
villages which were near the British lines, suffered
least, because the enemy wished not to discover their
intention of retreating. In these places some of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
corps had had their head-quarters for four months, and
some of the inhabitants had been induced to remain:
these people had now fresh proof of their delusion, in
supposing that honour or humanity were to be found in
the armies of Buonaparte: the French sacked their
houses, and destroyed as many as time permitted on the
night of their departure; and when their movements
could no longer be concealed, they burnt, by Massena’s
orders, every town and village through which they passed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Havoc at Alcobaça.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The most venerable structure in Portugal was the
convent of Alcobaça. Its foundation was coeval
with the monarchy. It had been the burial-place
of the kings of Portugal for many generations.
The munificence of nobles and princes, the craft
of superstition, and the industry and learning of its
members in better times, had contributed to fill this
splendid pile with treasures of every kind. Its gorgeous
vestments, its vessels of plate and gold, and its
almost matchless jewelry, excited the admiration of the
vulgar; the devotee and the philosopher were equally
astonished at the extraordinary articles in its Relic-room;
the artist and the antiquary beheld with wonder
and delight its exquisite monuments of ancient art; and
its archives and library were as important to Portugueze
literature, as the collections of the Museum or the Bodleian
are in our own country. Orders were issued from
the French head-quarters to burn this place: that the
work of destruction might be complete, it was begun in
time, and the mattock and hammer were employed to
destroy what the flames would have spared. The
tesselated pavement from the entrance to the high altar
was broken up with pickaxes, and the ornaments of the
pillars destroyed nearly up to the arches. The French,
who at this very time inserted an article in the capitulation
of Badajoz, that no stipulations were therein made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
respecting religion, because they were catholics like the
Spaniards, mutilated here the Crucifix and the images of
the Virgin, as if they studied in what manner they
could most effectually shock and insult the feelings of
the Portugueze. They cut the pictures which they did
not burn; they broke open the tombs. Those of Pedro
and Ignez de Castro were covered with historical sculptures:
rich as England is in remains of this kind, we
have none of equal antiquity which could be compared
with them for beauty, or for their value to the antiquarian;
and a story, hardly less generally known throughout
Europe than the most popular parts of classical history,
had in an especial manner sanctified these monuments.
These, therefore, were especial objects of the
enemy’s malice, and more laborious mischief was exerted
in destroying them, the tombs being so well constructed
as not without difficulty to be destroyed. Fire was at
length put to the monastery in many parts, and troops
set round it to prevent the people from making any
efforts to stop the conflagration. The edifice continued
burning for two-and-twenty days. Two of the Cistercian
brethren were afterwards appointed commissioners
to search the ruins. They found some bones of Queen
Orraca and part of her clothes; the body of Queen
Beatriz, in a state of good preservation, and that of
Pedro still entire, with the skin and hair upon it<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>. A
few fragments only of Ignez de Castro could be found.
These remains were deposited once more in the tombs,
and the monuments repaired, as far as reparation was
possible. The most valuable of the books and manuscripts
had happily been removed in time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Batalha.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Batalha was a structure equally sacred, and more
beautiful. Had King Emanuel completed the original
design, it would have excelled all other Gothic buildings;
even in its unfinished state, it was the admiration
of all who beheld it. It was founded upon
the spot where the tent of Joam I. stood on the
night before that battle which, for inferiority of numbers
on the part of the conqueror, may be compared with
Cressy, Poictiers, and Agincourt; and which, for the
permanent importance of its consequences, when considered
in all their bearings, is unparalleled. Here
Joam was buried, after a long and glorious reign, upon
the scene of his triumph; and here his four sons were
buried also, men worthy of such a father; one of them
being that Prince Henry whose grave, it might have
been thought, would have been equally respected by all
civilised nations. The monuments of these Infantes
and of their parents were in a state of correspondent
beauty with the temple in which they lay, and perfectly
preserved. They were broken open by the French, and
the remains of the dead taken from their graves to be
made the mockery of these ruffians, who kicked about
the head of Joam I. as a football, and left the body in
the pulpit, placed in the attitude of one preaching.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Direction of the enemy’s retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Regnier’s corps, which was the enemy’s left, had
moved from Santarem upon Thomar, from
thence towards Espinhal: their centre from
Pernes, by Torres Novas and Cham de Maçans,
and the right from Leyria. The two latter effected their
junction on the 9th in the plain before Pombal. What
course the enemy would take in their retreat could not
be foreseen: had they intended to retire by the way
which they had entered, it was thought they would have
sent a larger proportion by the Espinal road. The centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
of the allies had taken the same line as that of the
French; the right advanced upon Thomar, the left upon
Leyria. Our light troops had never lost sight of the
enemy; and when the centre and right joined before
Pombal, the British advanced guard, coming from Cham
de Maçans, saw their junction from the heights. A

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Affair before Pombal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

brisk affair took place that day before Pombal,
where the enemy had eight squadrons formed
in different parts of the plain, supported by
their whole cavalry. The 1st hussars and the 16th
light dragoons attacked the most advanced of these
squadrons, defeated them one after another, and drove
them all together in confusion on their support, the
troops composing which were repeatedly called upon by
their officers to advance, but would not move; for they
were quite dispirited, and satisfied with safety, seeing
the allies were not in sufficient force to pursue their
advantage. Lord Wellington could not collect a sufficient
body to commence an operation before the 11th,
when Loison, with three corps, and Montbrun’s division
of cavalry, were leaving a position in front of Pombal.
Having burnt the town, they attempted to hold the old
castle, which stands upon an eminence above the
Arunca; they were driven from thence, they then
formed on the farther side of the town, and our troops
did not arrive in time to complete the dispositions for
attacking them while it was day; ... but they were in
time to rescue six women from the flames, whom the
French had stripped naked, shut into a house, and then
set the house on fire! During the night the enemy retired,
and their rear took up a strong position between
Pombal and Redinha, formerly a city, now a town, but
bearing rather the appearance of a decayed village.
They were posted at the end of a defile in front of the</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Affair before Redinha.<br /><span class="date">March 12.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

town, their right in a wood upon the little river Danços,
their left extending to some heights upon the
same stream, which has its source about two
miles above the town. The light division,
under Sir William Erskine, the Portugueze
caçadores, under Colonel Elder, forming part, attacked
their right; and Lord Wellington, bearing testimony to
the merit of these allies, declared that he had never
seen the French infantry driven from a wood in more
gallant style. Our troops then formed in the plain
beyond the defile with great celerity, and Sir Brent
Spencer led them against the heights, from which the
French were immediately driven; but their skill was
conspicuous in every movement, and no local advantage
escaped them. Their retreat was by a narrow bridge,
and a ford close to it, over the Danços; our light troops
passed with them in pursuit, but they commanded these
passages with cannon, and gained time to form again
upon the nearest heights, before troops enough could
pass over to make a fresh disposition for attacking them.
As soon as this was done, they fell back upon their
main body at Condeixa; and there they sent out regular
parties to drive into the camp all females above
ten years of age, and these victims were delivered to
the soldiers!</p>

<p>There was now every reason to fear that Coimbra
would share the fate of Alcobaça, and Leyria, and Pombal,
and that the enemy, getting into Upper Beira, would
lay waste in their destructive course a tract of country
which had hitherto been preserved from their ravages;
or that Massena would endeavour to obtain possession of
Porto, and defend himself there better than Soult had
done. As soon as Lord Wellington had ascertained that
the enemy were directing their retreat toward the Mondego,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
which was on the fourth day after they retired

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 8.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

from Santarem, he dispatched advices to General
Bacelar, whose head-quarters were at S.
Pedro do Sul, directing him to send his baggage across
the Douro, to secure means for passing it himself, with
the troops under his command, and to take measures for
defending the passage both at Lamego and at Porto. It
was supposed in this dispatch that Colonel Trant would
have retired from Coimbra upon the Vouga, the bridge
over which river he was now ordered to destroy, and
then proceed to Porto. Trant, however, had intercepted
a letter from Drouet to Claparede (who was then near
Guarda), which led him to expect that the French would
speedily commence their retreat, and that it would be in
this direction; in consequence he destroyed an arch of
the bridge at Coimbra; and when the concentration of
their force at Pombal and Redinha made their course no
longer doubtful, he withdrew his post from Condeixa,
and evacuated the suburb of S. Clara, which is on the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French endeavour to get possession of Coimbra.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

left bank: this had just been effected on the
morning of the 11th, when General Montbrun
entered it with a large body of cavalry. Preparations
had been made for defending the
passage, and happily at that time the Mondego was not
fordable. The rivers in that part of the country are
rendered impassable for cavalry by a few hours’ rain, the
water pouring down to them from the mountains on
every side; but their course is so short, that they fall as
rapidly as they rise. Montbrun, having no guns with
him, could not return the fire of six six-pounders, the
only artillery which Trant possessed; he retired, therefore,
from S. Clara to the heights above it. This movement
prevented him from discovering that the river became
fordable in the course of the evening, and continued so
for some days following. During the night Trant received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
advice from Colonel Wilson, that the river had
become passable at a place some ten miles above the
city; and from the other hand he was informed that a
few of the enemy’s dragoons had actually crossed near
Montemor o Velho. Measures were immediately taken
for defending both fords; and the field-pieces were fired
occasionally, in the hope that they might be heard at the
advanced posts of the allied army, and Lord Wellington
thus be assured that Coimbra was not in the enemy’s
possession; but the wind was southerly, and the intention
therefore failed. Not doubting but that the French
were in retreat and the allies in close pursuit, Trant had
no thought of retiring from his post, when he now received
dispatches from Bacelar, inclosing Lord Wellington’s
instructions, wherein he was supposed already to
have withdrawn, and was ordered to take upon himself
the protection of Porto. These orders he obeyed, by
sending off the main body of the militia, during the
night of the 12th, toward Mealhada, remaining himself
with a detachment at the bridge. In the morning there
was no indication of an attempt upon the town; only a
few dragoons were to be seen on the heights of S. Clara;
he resolved, therefore, to place his division in a position,
and proceeded to join it for that purpose; instructing
the officer whom he left in command at the bridge, to
take nothing upon himself in case of any communication
from the enemy, but refer it to him, and act accordingly.
An hour had hardly elapsed, before Montbrun summoned
the city to surrender. The officer referred the summons
to Trant: it had been merely made to keep in check the
garrison which Montbrun supposed to be still there, and
in force; for that general having found them ready on
the 11th and 12th had advised Massena to retire by
the Ponte de Murcella; and when Lord Wellington
came up with the main body, who were strongly posted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
at Condeixa, to his great joy he perceived that they
were sending off their baggage in that direction. Immediately
he inferred that Coimbra was safe, and
marching General Picton’s division upon their left towards
this road, now the only one open for their retreat,
they were instantly dislodged, leaving Condeixa in
flames. The allies then communicated with Coimbra;
a detachment of cavalry, returning from their demonstration
against that important city, were made prisoners,
and Trant and Wilson were directed to move along the
right bank of the Mondego, and prevent the enemy from
sending detached parties across. In the order which
Massena issued for burning every town and village,
Coimbra had been particularly mentioned.</p>

<p>On the 14th the French rear-guard were driven from
a strong position at Casal Nova, where they had encamped
the preceding night. The whole line of their
retreat was full of advantageous positions, of which they
well knew how to avail themselves; but he who pursued
them was also a master in the art of war; and in
his own retreat had acquired a perfect knowledge of the
ground. Their outposts were driven in: they were dislodged
by flank movements from the posts which they
successively took in the mountains, and were flung back
with considerable loss upon the main body at Miranda
do Corvo, where it was well posted to receive and support
them. Here Regnier, with the second corps,
effected his junction, so that the whole French army was
now assembled. General Nightingale, who had pursued
this column, rejoined the British army the same day at
Espinhal: and as it was now in the power of Lord Wellington
to turn their position, they abandoned it during
the night.</p>

<p>A thick fog on the following morning gave them time,
and favoured their movements. Some deserters came in,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
who said that they were destroying carriages, baggage,
and ammunition. About nine the day cleared up, and
the troops, renewing the pursuit, passed through the
smoking ruins of Miranda do Corvo. Hitherto they had
only seen proofs of the cruelty of the enemy along the
road; they now began to see proofs of his distress; for
from this place the road was strewn with the wreck of a
retreating army, broken carriages, baggage, carcasses of
men and beasts, the wounded and the dying. Amid
this general havoc, nothing was more shocking than the
number of horses, asses, and mules, which the French,
when their strength failed, had hamstrung, and left to
suffer a slow death. To have killed them at once would
have been mercy, but mercy was a virtue which this
army seemed to have forsworn: it even appeared, by the
manner in which these poor creatures were grouped,
that Massena’s troops had made the cruelties which
they inflicted a matter of diversion to themselves!
Every day the bodies of women were seen whom they
had murdered. In one place some friars were hanging,
impaled by the throat upon the sharpened branches of a
tree. Everywhere peasants were found in the most
miserable condition; poor wretches who had fallen into
the hands of the French, and been tortured to make
them discover where supplies were hid, or made to serve
as guides, and when their knowledge of the way ended,
shot, that they might give no information to the pursuers.
The indignation of our army was what it ought
to be; men and officers alike exclaimed against the
atrocious conduct of their detestable enemies. “This,”
said Lord Wellington, “is the mode in which the promises
have been performed, and the assurances fulfilled,
which were held out in the proclamation of the French
commander-in-chief, when he told the inhabitants of
Portugal, that he was not come to make war upon them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
but, with a powerful army of an hundred and ten thousand
men, to drive the English into the sea! It is to
be hoped that the example of what has occurred in this
country will teach the people of this and of other nations,
what value they ought to place on such promises and
assurances; and that there is no security for life, or for
any thing that renders life valuable, except in decided
resistance to the enemy.”</p>

<p>The retreating army had no provisions except what
they plundered on the spot, and could carry on their
backs, and live cattle, with which they were well provided.
As far as Condeixa the allied troops had been
supplied by transport from Lisbon, to their own admiration,
so excellent had been the previous arrangement.
But as they advanced, they suffered more privations than
the enemy whom they were driving out of the country,
for the French left the land as a desert behind them,
and the commissariat could not keep up with the rapidity
of such a pursuit. The dragoons always kept sight, of
the enemy; they were constantly mounted before daybreak,
their horses were never unsaddled, and were
obliged to carry their own sustenance, which, it may be
supposed, was sufficiently scanty. In the midst of a
country where the people regarded them not merely as
allies, but as friends, brothers, and deliverers, that
people had not even shelter to afford them, and none of
the troops had tents; those which they occupied in the
lines were left there. But they reaped an abundant
reward in the success of their general’s well-concerted
and patient plan, in the anticipated applause of their
own countrymen, in the blessings of the Portugueze, and
in that feeling, ... of all others the happiest which can fall
to a soldier’s lot, ... that they were engaged in a good
cause, and that the wickedness of the enemy rendered it
as much a moral as a military duty to labour for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
destruction. With these feelings they attacked them
wherever they were found. Massena had taken up a
formidable position on the Ceyra, which falls into the
Mondego a few leagues above Coimbra, and is one of
the Portugueze rivers in whose bed gold has been found;
a whole corps was posted as an advanced guard in front
of Foz de Arouce, on the left side of the river. Here
Lord Wellington again moved his divisions upon their
right and left, and attacked them in front. In this affair
the French sustained a considerable loss, which was
much increased by a well-managed movement of the
English 95th. That regiment observed a body of the
enemy moving off in two parallel columns. There was
a woody cover between them, into which the 95th got,
the fog and the closing evening enabling them to do so
unperceived; from thence they fired on both sides, and
retiring instantly that the fire was returned, left the two
columns of the French to keep up a heavy fire upon
each other as they passed the cover. The darkness of
the night increased their confusion: many were drowned
in crossing the river, ... a mountain stream swoln by the
rains, ... and it is said that one column blew up the
bridge while the other was upon it. Much baggage,
and some ammunition carriages, here fell into the hands
of the pursuers. The light division got into the enemy’s
bivouac, and found not only some of their plunder there,
but their dinners on the fires. A heavy fog had delayed
the movements of the army, and prevented a more
serious attack, from which much had been expected.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 16.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Having blown up the bridge, the enemy’s rear-guard
took a position on the bank of the river, to
watch the ford. The loss which they had sustained
on the preceding day was betrayed in part by the
bodies which they had thrown into the water to conceal
it, but which were seen as the stream bore them down.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
Lord Wellington was obliged to halt the whole of the
following day for supplies, the rains having rendered
bad roads almost impassable. Here, too, the ill news
from Badajoz compelled him to order toward that frontier
a part of his army, which should otherwise have
continued in the pursuit. During the night, the French
moved off, and the pursuers forded the Ceyra on the
17th. On the 18th, they advanced toward the Ponte
de Murcella; the French, who, during the whole of the
retreat, made their marches by night, putting their
troops in motion a few hours after dusk, had retired
over this bridge and destroyed it, using the very mines
which the British had constructed for the same purpose,
on their retreat in the preceding autumn. They were
now posted in force on the right of the Alva. Lord
Wellington turned their left by the Serra de Santa
Quiteria, and manœuvred in their front; this compelled
them to retire upon Mouta. It was believed that they
had intended to remain some days in the position from
which they were thus driven, because many prisoners
were taken who had been sent out in foraging parties
toward the Mondego, and ordered to return to the Alva.
During the night the staff corps constructed a bridge
which was ready at daybreak for the infantry. The
cavalry passed at a ford close by, and there was some
difficulty in getting the artillery across. On the 19th,
they were assembled on the Serra de Mouta, the enemy,
as usual, having retired in the night. From this place
they continued their retreat with the utmost rapidity.
Lord Wellington kept up the pursuit with only the
cavalry and the light division under Sir William
Erskine, supported by two divisions of infantry, and by
the militia on the right of the Mondego. The remainder
of the army was obliged to halt, till the supplies,
which had been sent round from the Tagus to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Mondego, should arrive; this was absolutely necessary,
for nothing could be found in the country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Resistance made by the peasantry.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The peasants did not everywhere abandon their
villages to the spoilers; in some places they
found means to arm themselves, and their
appearance deterred the enemy from making
their intended attack, the pursuers being so near at
hand; in others they entered the burning villages with
the foremost of the allied army in time to extinguish the
flames. There is a village called Avo, six-and-thirty
miles from Coimbra, containing about 130 houses.
The ordenanza of that district were collected there; they
repelled a body of 500 French in five different attacks,
and saved the village. The little town of Manteigas
was less fortunate. The inhabitants of the adjoining
country, confiding in the situation of a place which
was, as they hoped, concealed in the heart of the Serra
de Estrella, had brought their women and children
thither, and their most valuable effects; but it was discovered,
and in spite of a desperate defence, the town
was stormed, by a force as superior in number as in
arms. The officers carried off the handsomest women;
the rest were given up to the mercy of men as brutal as
their leaders. But everywhere the naked bodies of the
straggling and wounded, which the English found upon
the way, showed well what vengeance these most injured
people had taken upon their unprovoked and
inhuman enemies. In one place a party of them were
surprised in a church digging the dead out of their
graves in search of plunder.</p>

<p>As the French drew nearer the frontier, their foraging
parties assumed more confidence, and at the same time
their wants becoming more urgent, made them more
daring. They passed the fords of the Mondego near
Fornos, in considerable numbers, to seek supplies in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
country as yet unravaged; but they were attacked by
Wilson, who pursued them across the river and captured
a great number of beasts of burthen, laden with
plunder of every description, which they abandoned in
their flight. He took several prisoners also, and in consequence
of the loss which they had thus sustained a
strong division was detached against him, which took a
position on the left bank of the river, so as to cover the
flank of the retiring columns from any further operations
of this militia force, till they had passed Celorico.
Lord Wellington, for want of supplies, was not able to
proceed till the 26th, when he advanced to Gouvea,
halted, again the next day, and on the following reached
Celorico. The French were then at Guarda, which
they occupied in strength, and where they apparently
intended to maintain themselves. Between Celorico
and that city, the inhabitants of a village, men and
women alike, were found dead or dying in the street,
their ears and noses cut off, and otherwise mangled in a
manner not to be described. The horror and indignation
of the allies were raised to the highest pitch by this
dreadful sight; and the advanced guard coming up with
some hundreds of the guilty troops, whose retreat had
been impeded by the premature destruction of a bridge,
gave them as little quarter as they deserved. But as
the enemy only passed through this part of the country,
it had not suffered so much as those places where they
had been stationary, and consequently had had leisure
to prepare<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> for the work of barbarous devastation
which their Generals had determined upon committing.
Not having time now to destroy every thing before
them, they burnt only the principal houses: poorer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
habitations escaped; and the peasants who had fled
before the retreating army to the mountains no sooner
saw the allies come up, than they returned to their
dwellings, baked bread for their deliverers from the
corn which they had concealed, and did every thing in
their power to assist them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Guarda.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Guarda stands upon a plain of the Serra de Estrella
(the Mons Herminius of the Romans) near the
sources of the Zezere and the Mondego, and
near the highest part of that lofty range; its site is said
to be higher than that of any other city in Europe;
the ascent to it continues nearly four miles, by a road
wide enough for two carts abreast, winding in numberless
sinuations along the edge of a deep precipice, the
sides of which are overspread with trees. The city
indeed owes its origin to this commanding situation,
having grown round a watch tower (called in those days
<i>guarda</i>) which Sancho the First erected there in the
first age of the monarchy. Lord Wellington collected his
army in the neighbourhood and in the front of Celorico,
with a view to dislodge the enemy from this advantageous
post. The following day he moved forward in
five columns, supported by a division in the valley of the
Mondego; the militia under Trant and Wilson covering
the movement at Alverca against any attempt which
might have been made against it on that side. So
well were the movements concerted, that the heads of
the different columns made their appearance on the
heights almost at the same moment; upon which the
enemy, without firing a shot, retired upon Sabugal on
the Upper Coa; for although Dumouriez, with his
superficial knowledge of the country, had spoken of
Guarda as the key of Portugal, and upon that authority it
has been described as one of the finest military positions
in the kingdom, the French Generals perceived that its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
apparent strength only rendered it more treacherous,
and were too prudent to attempt making a stand there,
against one whom they now could not but in their hearts
acknowledge to be at least their equal in the art of war.
Their retreat was so rapid that they had not time to
execute the mischief which they intended; our troops
entered in time to save the Cathedral, the door of which
was on fire: the wood of its fine organ had been taken
by the enemy for fuel, and the pipes for bullets. They
took a strong position, their right at Ruvina guarding
the ford of Rapoula de Coa, with a detachment at the
bridge of Ferreiros; their left was at Sabugal, and their
8th corps at Alfayates. The right of the allied army
was opposite Sabugal, their left at the bridge of Ferreiros,
and Trant and Wilson were sent across the Coa
below Almeida, to threaten the communication of that
place with Ciudad Rodrigo and with the enemy’s army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Coa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The river Coa rises in the Sierra de Xalma, which
forms a part of the great Sierra de Gata; and
entering Portugal by Folgozinho, falls into the
Douro near Villa Nova de Foscoa. The whole of its
course is through one of the most picturesque countries
in Europe, and it is everywhere difficult of access.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sabugal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Sabugal stands on the right bank. This town
was founded about the year 1220, by Alonso
X. of Leon, who named it from the number of elder-trees
(<i>sabugos</i>) growing about it: the place is now remarkable
for some of the largest chesnut-trees that are anywhere to
be seen. It was afterwards annexed to the Portugueze
dominions, and its old castle still remains a monument of
king Diniz, whose magnificent works are found over the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

whole kingdom. The enemy’s second corps
were strongly posted with their right upon a
height immediately above the bridge and town, and
their left extending along the road to Alfayates, to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
height which commanded all the approaches to Sabugal
from the fords above the town. They communicated by
Rendo with the sixth corps at Ruvina. It was only on
the left above Sabugal that they could be approached;
our troops, therefore, were put in motion on the morning

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Action before Sabugal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the 3rd of April, to turn them in this
direction, and to force the passage of the
bridge of Sabugal. The light division and the
cavalry, under Sir W. Erskine and Major-General
Slade, were to cross the Coa by two separate fords
upon the right, the cavalry upon the right of the light
division; the third division, under Major-General Picton,
at a ford on the left about a mile above Sabugal;
the fifth division, under Major-General Dunlop, and the
artillery at the bridge. The sixth division remained
opposite the enemy’s corps at Ruvina, and a battalion of
the seventh observed their detachment at the bridge of
Ferreiros. Colonel Beckwith’s brigade of the light division
was the first that crossed, with two squadrons of
cavalry upon its right; the riflemen skirmished; the
enemy’s picquets fell back from the river as they advanced:
they forded, gained the opposite height, formed
as the companies arrived, and moved forward under a
heavy fire. At this time so thick a rain came on, that
it was impossible to see any thing before them, and the
troops pushing forward in pursuit of the picquets, came
upon the left of the main body, which it was intended
they should turn. The light troops were driven back
upon the 43rd regiment; and Regnier, who commanded
the French, perceiving, as soon as the atmosphere
cleared, that the body which had advanced was not
strong, attacked it in solid column, supported by artillery
and horse. The allies repulsed it, and advanced in
pursuit upon the position. They found a strong enclosure
in the front lined with a battalion; and the enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
forming fresh and stronger bodies, attacked them with
the hussars on the right, and a fresh column on the left.
Our troops retired, took post behind a wall, formed
again under a heavy fire of grape, canister, and musketry,
again repulsed the enemy, again advanced against
them, and took from them a howitzer posted in the rear
of the French battalion, which was formed under cover
of that in the stone enclosure: this gun had greatly
annoyed the allies. They had advanced with such
impetuosity that their front was somewhat scattered; a
fresh column with cavalry attacked them; they retired
again to their post, where the battalions of the 52nd and
the 1st Caçadores joined them: these troops once more
repulsed the enemy, and Colonel Beckwith’s brigade,
with the first battalion of the 52nd, again advanced upon
them. Another column of the French, with cavalry,
charged their right: but they took post in the stone
enclosure on the top of the height, from whence they
could protect the howitzer which had been won, and
they again drove back the enemy. Regnier had moved
a column on their left to renew the attack, when part of
General Picton’s division came up; the head of General
Dunlop’s column forced the bridge at the same time,
and ascended the heights on the right flank; the cavalry
appeared on the high ground in rear of their left, and
Regnier then retreated across the hills towards Rendo,
leaving the howitzer in the hands of those by whom it
had been so gallantly won; about 200 were left on the
field, with six officers and 300 prisoners. Our loss in
killed, wounded, and prisoners, amounted to 161.
What that of the French was in wounded is not known.
They retired in the greatest disorder, cavalry, artillery,
infantry, and baggage, all mixed. A fog favoured
them, otherwise a good account would have been given
of half their corps. Lord Wellington described this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
action, though the unavoidable accidents of weather
had materially interfered with the operations, and impeded
their success, as one of the most glorious that
British troops were ever engaged in.</p>

<p>Regnier joined the sixth corps at Rendo; for it had
broken up from its position at Ruvina as soon as the
firing began; they retreated to Alfayates, followed by
our cavalry; that night they continued their retreat, and
entered the Spanish frontier on the fourth. On the following
day the advance of the allied army pushed on,
and occupied Albergaria, the first village on the Spanish
border. An inhabited village was what they had not
seen before since their retreat in the autumn, those
excepted which were within the lines of Torres Vedras.
The villages in Spain had not been injured; it seemed as
if the French wished to make the Spaniards on this frontier
compare their own condition with that of the Portugueze,
that they might become contented with subjection.
Massena’s soldiers even paid here for bread;
and arriving not only hungry, but with a longing desire
for that which is to them the most necessary article of
food, they paid any price for it: the peasants seeing
that they were rich in plunder, and finding them in the
paying mood, made their charges accordingly. This
sudden transition from a devastated country to one
which had been exempted from the ravages of war,
where the villages were clean, and the cottages reminded
Englishmen of those in their own land, was not
less striking than was the passing at once from a wild
mountainous region to a fine and well-wooded plain.</p>

<p>Some hope was entertained that the appearance of
Trant and Wilson’s force before Almeida might make
the French apprehend a serious attack, and induce them
to evacuate it. But throughout the war they never
committed any error of this kind. It rarely happened in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
their service that any person was appointed to a situation
for which he was not well qualified; and the commander
of this fortress, General Brenier, was a man of
more than common qualifications. The Coa, after these
divisions crossed it at Cinco Villas, rose; and the
governor concerted with General Regnier an attack
upon them, which, their retreat being thus cut off, must
have ended in their destruction, if Lord Wellington,
apprehending the danger, had not pushed forward a
small corps, which arrived just in time to divert the
enemy’s attention, and save them. On the eighth the
last of Massena’s army crossed the Agueda, not a

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French cross the frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Frenchman remaining in Portugal, except the
garrison of Almeida, which Lord Wellington
immediately prepared to blockade. The allies
took up that position upon the Duas Casas, which General
Craufurd had occupied with the advanced guard
during the latter part of the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo,
having their advanced posts upon Galegos and the
Agueda. Thus terminated the invasion of Portugal, in
which Massena, with 110,000 men, had boasted that he
would drive the English into the sea. A general of the
highest reputation, and of abilities no ways inferior to
his celebrity, at the head of the largest force which
France could send against that country, was thus in all
his plans baffled by a British general, and in every engagement
beaten by British troops. An enemy the
most presumptuous and insolent that ever disgraced the
profession of arms, the most cruel that ever outraged
human nature, had been humbled and exposed in the
face of Europe; ... it was in vain for the French Government
to call their retreat a change of position, ... however
they might disguise and misrepresent the transactions in
Portugal, however they might claim victories where they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
had sustained defeats, the map discovered here their
undeniable discomfiture; and the smallest kingdom in
Europe, a kingdom too which long misgovernment had
reduced to the most deplorable state of disorganization,
had, by the help of England and the spirit of its inhabitants,
defied and defeated that tyrant before whom the
whole continent was humbled. Russia had been so
foiled in arms and dressed in negociation so as to become
the ally of France, to co-operate in her barbarous warfare
against commerce, and to recognise her extravagant
usurpations. Prussia had been beaten and reduced to
vassalage. Austria was still farther degraded by being
compelled to give a daughter of its emperor in marriage
to one whose crimes that emperor himself had proclaimed
to the world. Poles and Italians, Dutch and Germans,
from every part of divided and subjected Germany, filled
up the armies of this barbarian; and the Portugueze, ...
the poor, degraded, and despised Portugueze, ... the
vilified, the injured, the insulted Portugueze, ... were
the first people who drove this formidable enemy out of
their country, and delivered themselves from the yoke.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 18.</span><br />Opinions of the Whigs at this time.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While Massena was retreating, and before the intelligence
arrived in England, a debate took place
in both houses, upon a motion, that two millions
should be granted for the Portugueze troops in
British pay. The opposition did not let pass
this opportunity of repeating their opinions and their

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Ponsonby.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

prophecies, ... in happy hour! Mr. Ponsonby
said, that our success consisted in having lost
almost the whole of Portugal, and having our army
hemmed in between Lisbon and Cartaxo; except that
intermediate space, we had abandoned all Portugal.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Freemantle.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Mr. Freemantle, after a panegyric upon Sir
John Moore’s retreat, said that the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
campaign left Lord Wellington incapable of quitting his
intrenchments, and only waiting the result of such movements
as the enemy might be disposed to make. “It
rests with the enemy,” said he, “to choose his day, to
make his own dispositions, to wait for his reinforcements,
to choose whether he will continue to blockade
you, or whether he will give you a fair opportunity of
contending with him in the field. If we are to judge by
the publications in France, he will decide upon the
former; and in this he will judge wisely. The result of
all your victories, of all your expenditure in men and
money, of all your exertions, and of all your waste of the
military resources of this country, is ... the position of
your army at Lisbon, insulated and incapable of acting,
but at the discretion of the enemy: your allies in every
other part of the peninsula overwhelmed, and only manifesting
partial and unavailable hostility; your own resources
exhausted, and your hopes of ultimate success,
to every mind which is not blinded by enthusiasm, completely
annihilated! Such is the result of a system
founded upon the principle of attempting to subdue
Buonaparte by the force of your armies on the continent!
Will any man say that this has been a wise
system? Will any man, who is not determined, under
any circumstances, to support the measures of a weak
and misguided government, contend that it has been
successful? that it has answered either the promises to
your allies, or the hopes to your country? that it has
either contributed to their security, or to your own
benefit?”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Tarleton.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>General Tarleton also delivered it as his opinion, that
we had lost the whole of the peninsula, except
the spot between Cartaxo and Lisbon; that the
Portugueze troops had never been of any actual service;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
that we could not maintain ourselves in the country, for
the fatal truth must at length be told; and that when
our army was to get out of it, he was afraid it would be

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Grenville.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

found a difficult matter. Lord Grenville, in the
Upper House, spoke to the same purport, affirming
that the British army in Portugal did not possess
more of the country than the ground which it actually
occupied, and that while we were vainly draining our
own resources, and hazarding our best means, we did
not essentially contribute to help Portugal, or to save it.
It was, he added, because he had the cause of Spain and
Portugal sincerely and warmly at heart, that he felt
anxious we should pause in this wild and mad career of
thoughtless prodigality, look our own situation in the
face, and learn the necessity of economising our resources,
that we might be able, at a period more favourable
than the present, to lend to the cause of the nations
of the Peninsula, or to that of any other country similarly
situated, that support and those exertions which, when
made under all the circumstances of our present situation,
must be found not only wholly unavailing to our
allies, but highly injurious to ourselves.</p>

<p>Two days after these opinions were delivered, the
telegraph announced the news of Massena’s retreat.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1811.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">About</span> the same time that the tide had thus turned
in Portugal, came tidings of a victory in Spain, which,
if it led to no other result, tended to raise the character
of the British army, and the spirits of the nation. When
Soult marched against Badajoz, hoping to co-operate
with Massena in the conquest of Portugal, he made

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Expedition from Cadiz.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

such large drafts from the army before Cadiz,
that it was thought possible, by a well-concerted
attack, to raise the blockade. The plan was, that
an expedition should sail from Cadiz, and force a landing
between Cape Trafalgar and Cape de Plata, or at Tarifa,
or at Algeciras. The Spanish force at St. Roques was
then to join, and a combined attack to be made upon
the rear of the enemy’s line; while, in the meantime,
an attempt should be made from the Isle of Leon to
open a communication with them. D. Manuel de Lapeña
was appointed to the command. He had conducted the
wreck of the central army during the latter part of its
retreat, under circumstances in which no military skill
could be displayed, but in which his patriotism and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lieutenant-General Graham.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

moderation had been fully proved. Lieutenant-General
Graham, who commanded the British troops
at Cadiz, consented to act under him. This
officer was now in his sixty-first year. The
former part of his life he had passed in the enjoyments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
of domestic comfort, amusing himself with rural sports,
with improving his estates, and with literature: after
eighteen years of happiness his wife died on the way to
the south of France, and Mr. Graham, seeking for relief
in change of place, and in active occupations, joined
Lord Hood as a volunteer when Toulon was taken possession
of in 1793. Here he distinguished himself
greatly, and on his return to England obtained permission
to raise a regiment, but not without great difficulty
and express discouragement from the commander-in-chief.
He was at Mantua with Wurmser in 1796,
and escaped by cutting his way through the besiegers
in a night sortie: and he bore a distinguished part at
Malta when Sir Alexander Ball, under circumstances
the most painful, and with means the most inadequate,
by his wisdom and perseverance recovered that island
from the enemy. Nevertheless the time of life at which
he had entered the army, and the manner, impeded his
promotion; and he would probably never have risen in
rank if General Moore had not experienced great assistance
from him in his retreat, and at the battle of Coruña,
and sent home so strong a recommendation that it could
not be neglected.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Apprehensions of the enemy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The expedition, though upon no extensive scale, was
yet a great exertion for a government so poor in
means as the Regency, so feeble, and with all
its branches so miserably disorganised. The
bustle in the roads was visible from the enemy’s lines, as
well as from the city; in Cadiz the highest hopes were
excited, and Marshal Victor felt no little degree of
alarm. He thought that when Soult had so considerably
weakened the blockading force, he ought to have placed
Sebastiani’s army at his disposal, in case of need: this
had not been done, and Victor, seeing the naval preparations,
sent to that general, entreating him to manœuvre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
so as to alarm the allies upon their landing,
and to endanger them; but his entreaties were of no
effect, and Victor complained in his public dispatches,
that this corps, though numerous, in good condition,
and at leisure, had not given him the least assistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">February.</span><br />The troops land at Algeciras.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During the latter days of January and great part of
the following month, heavy rains delayed the
expedition, and rendered all the roads impracticable
by which the allies could have approached
the enemy. On the 20th of February,
the troops were embarked, waiting a favourable
opportunity to proceed into the Straits: General Graham
had about 4000 British and Portugueze, the Spaniards
were 7000. The British got to sea the next day, and
not being able to effect a landing near Cape Trafalgar,
nor at Tarifa, disembarked at Algeciras, from whence
they marched to Tarifa. The roads between the two
towns were impassable for carriages, and therefore the
artillery, provisions, and stores, were conveyed in boats,
by indefatigable exertions of the seamen, against every
disadvantage of wind and weather. The Spanish transports
were thrice driven back, but reached Tarifa on the
evening of the 27th, and the next day they began their

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>They pass the Puerto de Facinas.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

march to the Puerto de Facinas, a pass in that
chain of mountains which, bounding the plain
of Gibraltar on the west, runs to the sea from
the Sierras of Ronda. To this point the road was practicable
for carriages, some days’ labour having been employed
in making it so: from thence it descends to those
spacious plains which extend from the skirts of the chain
to Medina Sidonia, Chiclana, and the river Santi Petri:
and the roads below were in a dreadful state, the
country being marshy, intersected with a labyrinth of
streams; one of which, the Barbate, which receives the
waters of the Lake of Janda, is a considerable river. At<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Veger, about half way between Tarifa and the Isle of
Leon, the French had three companies of infantry and
180 horse. They had also a small fort with two pieces
of cannon at Casas Viejas, on the road to Medina.
These points it was hoped to surprise, and the troops
therefore encamped on the side of the mountain, taking
every precaution to conceal their movements from the
enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lapeña’s proclamation.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lapeña, when the troops commenced their march,
addressed a proclamation to them, which at
once disclosed the extent of his object, and the
confidence with which he expected to realize it.
“Soldiers of the fourth army,” said he, “the moment for
which you have a whole year been longing is at length
arrived: a second time Andalusia is about to owe to you
her liberty, and the laurels of Mengibar and Baylen will
revive upon your brows. You have to combat in sight
of the whole nation assembled in its Cortes; the Government
will see your deeds; the inhabitants of Cadiz,
who have made so many sacrifices for you, will be
eye-witnesses of your heroism; they will lift up their
voices in blessings and in acclamations of praise, which
you will hear amid the roar of musketry and cannon.
Let us go then to conquer! my cares are directed to
this end; implicit obedience, firmness, and discipline,
must conduct you to it: if these are wanting, in vain
will you seek for fortune! and woe to him who forgets
or abandons them: he shall die without remission! The
gold, whose weight makes cowards of those who have
plundered it from us, the bounties which a generous
Government will bestow, and the endless blessings of
those who will call you their deliverers, ... behold in
these your reward!” At Facinas the operations were
to commence; here, therefore, the order of march was
arranged, and the troops formed into three divisions, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
van being under General D. Jose Lardizabal, the centre
under Camp-Marshal the Prince of Anglona, and the
reserve under General Graham.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance against Veger.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At night-fall on the first of March, a detachment
under Colonel D. José Aymerich with two four-pounders,
began its march to surprise Veger.
A squadron accompanied it under the first adjutant
of the staff, Major-General Wall, as far as the
Fuente del Hierro, where these two parties separated,
Aymerich taking the direct line for Veger, Wall going to
the right across the lake of La Janda and the river Barbate,
to cut off the retreat of the enemy by the roads to
Medina and Chiclana. It was hardly probable that he
should succeed in this attempt, for the way was not only
circuitous and full of difficulties, but there was also
another road, that of Conil, by which they might make
their retreat, and which lay so wide of the others, that
it could not be occupied: Wall’s movement, however,
covered Aymerich’s, and facilitated his operations. The
Barbate is navigable as far as Veger bridge, where it
touches the foot of the high hill upon which Veger
stands. At this bridge Aymerich arrived in the morning;
it was fortified, and the French, under every advantage
of situation, were preparing to defend it, when
Wall’s cavalry appeared on the other side; upon this
they retired by the Conil road fast enough to effect
their retreat. Three of their gun-boats and three pieces
of cannon were taken here; the enemy suffered no other
loss, but the chief object in view was accomplished, for
the possession of this post secured the flank of the allies.</p>

<p>Meantime the main body advanced against Casas
Viejas: the distance being twelve miles, Lapeña supposed,
from the information of his guides, that he should
arrive some hours before daybreak. But there were so
many streams to cross, and so many intervening marshes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
that notwithstanding the hard labour of the pioneers,
and the utmost exertions of the artillery officers, these
twelve miles were a journey of twelve painful hours,
so that he did not arrive in time to reconnoitre the fort
before it was broad day. The enemy having fired a few
shot, took post upon a hill behind the fort, on the
Medina road. The German hussars in the British service,
and the Spanish carbineers under General Whittingham,
were ordered to wheel round upon the enemy’s
right, and surround them in that direction, while Baron

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Carondelet, with another squadron of cavalry,
forded the Barbate, and crossing a flooded
marsh, where the water was up to their saddle-girths,
advanced to charge them. Two battalions of infantry,
the one Spanish, the other English, crossed at the same
time to support him; and the enemy presently gave way,
leaving about thirty killed and wounded, thirty-three
prisoners, two pieces of cannon, and all their stores.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junction of the troops from St. Roques.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The troops from St. Roques joined this day, marching
by way of Las Casas de Castaño, and leaving a
small detachment in Alcala de los Gazules.
This division, consisting of 1600 men, was
added to the centre, whose force now amounted to 6000;
that of the vanguard was 2100, that of the rear 3100,
4300 being British and Portugueze, the rest Spaniards.
The cavalry were in a separate body under Whittingham.
The whole force, when thus united, consisted of
11,200 foot, 800 horse<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>. They had twenty-four pieces
of cannon. Lapeña’s plan was now to march by Veger,
upon the Santi Petri, and attack the intrenchments
there which formed the left of the enemy’s lines. Thus
the pass of the river would be laid open, and a communication<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
established with the Isle of Leon, from
whence the army might receive provisions, which it
now began to want, and might be reinforced with artillery,
foot, and horse: thus too they might combine
their operations with those which would be made from
the Spanish line of defence, and from the bay, in such
manner, that while the success appeared almost certain,
the risk, even in case of defeat, would be avoided, which
must be incurred upon any other plan from the nature of
the ground and the want of stores. Victor did not suspect
that any difficulties upon this head could influence
the movements of the allies, and he seems to have expected
that his position would be attacked in a more
vital part. He reinforced with a battalion of voltigeurs
General Cassagne, who occupied Medina Sidonia with
three battalions and a regiment of chasseurs; and he
took a position himself with ten battalions at the Cortijo
de Guerra, the intermediate point between Medina and
Chiclana, from whence he could bear upon the allies in
case they should advance upon either. General Lapeña,
however, had no thought of moving upon Medina: “it
was strong by nature,” he said, “fortified with seven
pieces of cannon, besides some in its castle, and distant
only two leagues from the Cortijo.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French attack Zayas, and are repulsed.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Camp-Marshal D. Jose de Zayas, who commanded in
the Isle of Leon, meantime had well performed
his part of the concerted operations. He pushed
a body of troops over the Santi Petri, near the
coast, on the first, threw a pontoon bridge across, and
formed a tete-du-pont the following evening. The
French General Villatte was immediately ordered to
attack this point during the night, and, in French customary
phrase, to drive the Spaniards into the sea.
About midnight the enemy made their attack with three
regiments, and by dint of superior numbers forced their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
way into the works at various points. Zayas speedily
reinforced the post, and drove them out with the bayonet:
it was wholly an affair of the bayonet, for the
troops were too much intermingled to permit of firing.
Some of the French had reached the middle of the
bridge, others crossed it, probably as the best means of
saving themselves when they found that they had
pushed on too far; they fell in with the Spaniards who
were hastening to assist their comrades, and in this
manner effected their escape.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Passage of the lake of Junda.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Having failed in this attempt, Victor marched towards
Chiclana, and ordered Cassagne to join him
from the Cortijo, rightly concluding that Lapeña
meant to attack the French lines at Santi Petri,
which, should he succeed, would enable him to receive
reinforcements from the Isle, and then he would march
upon Chiclana. The Spanish general thought to deceive
him into a belief that the attack would be made
by Medina, and for this purpose left a party at Casas
Viejas to mount guard, and keep up fires, as if the
whole force was there, while on the third they proceeded
to Veger. An excess of caution seems to have
been Lapeña’s failing; lest the enemy from Medina,
which was about ten miles from the beaten road, should
think of attacking him upon his march, he chose a by-road
on the left of the Barbate, unfrequented, because
there is the lake of Junda to be crossed on the way.
This lake is a considerable piece of water, between the
two roads from Tarifa to Medina Sidonia and to Chiclana.
The bottom consists of mud; but to render it
fordable, a stone causeway had been built, rather under
than in the water, about six feet wide, and some 500
yards in length, bushes and poles being fixed at intervals
to mark its edge, and prevent the traveller from
stepping into the mud. At this time the water upon the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
causeway was in some places more than mid-deep. The
Spaniards were some hours in passing, Lapeña exhorting
them from his horse; and many of the officers made the
men carry them across, while our officers were encouraging
their soldiers by example, and General Graham
was in the water on foot. On the evening of the
4th, they advanced from Veger, by way of Conil, towards
Santi Petri. This place Lapeña hoped to reach
by daybreak; but upon entering a wood about ten
miles from the village, and about as much in extent, his
advanced guard was suddenly attacked by some cavalry
who sallied from the cover. The enemy were repelled,
but the column halted while the wood was explored;
and this, with the doubt and hesitation of the guides,
heightened by the fears and feelings which night excited,
and the local circumstances of a country where
carriages seldom or never passed, caused a delay of two
hours, so that they did not get out of the wood till it
was broad day; and the hope which Lapeña had with
little reason indulged, of surprising his vigilant enemy,
was destroyed. The three divisions therefore advanced
in as many columns; their movements could not possibly
be concealed; the enemy did not appear to molest
them, but an officer of the French staff was seen singly
reconnoitring them. The operation was to commence
from a height called the Cabeza del Puerco: they
halted here to refresh themselves, and Lapeña harangued
the van which was destined to make the attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of the enemy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The lines which were to be attacked formed the left
of the French works. They were supported by
the sea on one side, on the other by the channel
of Alcornocal, and the fortified mill of Almansa.
Villatte had about 4000 men to defend this position, but
his force had been considerably weakened in his unsuccessful
attempt upon the tete-du-pont. He had, however,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
very considerable advantage in the nature of the
broken ground, a thick wood through which the assailant
must advance, and the perfect knowledge, which,
in the course of twelve months’ undisturbed possession,
he had acquired of every path and every inequality of
surface. This wood so covered the enemy, that only
four of their battalions in the first line were visible;
they had their right supported by the Torre Bermeja,
and three guns in their centre. Lardizabal, reinforced
by part of the second division, advanced to attack
them: the remainder of the troops held a position upon
the Cabeza del Puerco, or hill of Barrosa, the cavalry
being in advance upon the right.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Communication with the Isle of Leon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Villatte anticipated their movements, and fell upon
both flanks of Lardizabal’s advance at the same
time; at first he had the advantage, ... but the
regiment of Murcia, under its Colonel D. Juan
Maria Muñoz, checked his progress, Lardizabal with a
battalion of the Canaries attacked his right, and the
Spanish guards, and the regiment of Africa, under
Brigadier D. Raymundo Ferrer, and Colonel D. Tomas
Retortillo, charged with the bayonet. The enemy were
routed, and the communication with the Isle of Leon
was thus opened by this well-conducted and successful
attack. Two battalions of the French escaped and
carried off their field-pieces, the nature of the ground
saving them. Lapeña’s first object was thus accomplished,
and in order to maintain the important position
that he had gained, which had in its front a thick pine
forest, extending to Chiclana, and which he apprehended
the enemy would use their utmost efforts to recover,
he directed, in concert with General Graham,
that the British troops should move down from Barrosa
towards the Torre de Bermeja, leaving some Spanish
regiments under Brigadier Begines upon the heights.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
The position which it was intended to occupy is formed
by a narrow woody ridge, the right on the sea cliff,
the left falling down to the creek of Almansa on the
edge of a marsh. From the position of Barrosa to
that of Bermeja, the communication is easy, along a
hard sandy beach upon the west. General Graham’s
division had halted on the eastern slope; his road
therefore lay through the wood, and having sent
cavalry patroles toward Chiclana, who saw nothing of
the enemy, he began his march about noon.</p>

<p>General Lacy, the chief of the Spanish staff, was
sent forward by Lapeña to maintain the heights of
Bermeja; here it was that the danger was apprehended;
and the firing had recommenced in that direction.
The nature of the ground was such, that
what was passing at Barrosa could not be seen at
Bermeja; perhaps there was a deficiency in those
arrangements, by which, in a well-organized army,
information of what is passing in one part is rapidly
conveyed to another; and there was certainly the want
of a good intelligence between General Graham and the
Spanish commander under whom he had consented to
act. The British troops had proceeded about half way,
and were in the middle of the wood, when they were
informed that the enemy was appearing in force upon
the plain, and advancing towards the heights of Barrosa.
That position General Graham considered as the key to
that of Santi Petri, and immediately countermarched in
order to support the troops who had been left for its
defence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Heights of Barrosa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The heights of Barrosa extend to the shore on one
side, and slope down to the plain on the other
towards a lake called the Laguna del Puerco:
the ridge itself was called Cabeza del Puerco by the
Spaniards, but it will retain the better name which was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
this day acquired for it. Victor with 8000 men advanced
against this point. The troops which had been
left there were the regiments of Siguenza and Cantabria,
a battalion of Ciudad Real, another of the Walloon
guards, and a battalion of the King’s German legion.
Ignorant of Graham’s movements, and knowing themselves
unable to maintain the post against such very superior
numbers, they thought it best to form a junction
with the British, whose rear they should by this means
cover, and be themselves covered on the way by the pine
forest through which they were to pass. Accordingly
they made this movement with perfect coolness and in
perfect order, General Whittingham covering one flank,
Brigadier D. Juan de la Cruz Mourgeon the other; for
on both sides the enemy endeavoured to envelope them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Graham marches back to the heights.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Graham, meantime, was marching rapidly back, but
at a distance from the shore; whereas these
troops kept near it, apparently to lessen the
danger of being turned on that side by the
enemy’s light infantry. In such intricate and
difficult circumstances it was impossible to preserve
order in the columns; and before the troops were quite
disentangled from the wood, they saw that the detachment
which they were hastening to support had left the
heights; that the left wing of the French were rapidly
ascending there, and their right stood upon the plain, on
the edge of the wood within cannon shot. General Graham’s
object in countermarching had been to support the
troops in maintaining the heights; “but a retreat,” he
says, “in the face of such an enemy (already within
reach of the easy communication by the sea beach) must
have involved the whole allied army in all the danger
of being attacked during the unavoidable confusion of
the different corps arriving on the narrow ridge of Bermeja
nearly at the same time.” Trusting, therefore, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
the courage of his men, and regardless of the numbers
and position of the enemy, he resolved immediately to
attack them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of Barrosa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Marshal Victor commanded the French; General
Ruffin, whose name was well known in the
history of this wicked war, commanded the left
upon the hill; General Leval the right. Graham
formed his troops as rapidly as the circumstances required;
there was no time to restore order in his
columns, which had unavoidably been broken in marching
through the wood. The brigade of guards, Lieutenant-Colonel
Browne’s flank battalion of the 28th,
Lieutenant-Colonel Norcott’s two companies of the 2nd
rifle corps, and Major Acheson, with a part of the 57th
(separated from the regiment in the wood), formed on
the right under Brigadier-General Dilkes. Colonel
Wheatley’s brigade, with three companies of the Coldstream
guards, under Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson,
(separated likewise from his battalion in the wood,) and
Lieutenant-Colonel Barnard’s flank battalion, formed on
the left; Major Duncan, opening a powerful battery of
ten guns in the centre, protected the formation of the
infantry; and as soon as they were thus hastily got together,
the guns were advanced to a more favourable
position, and kept up a most destructive fire.</p>

<p>Leval’s division, notwithstanding the havoc which this
battery made, continued to advance in imposing masses,
opening its fire of musketry. The British left wing
advanced against it, firing. The three companies of
guards, and the 87th, supported by the remainder of the
wing, charged them with right British bravery; Colonel
Bilson with the 28th, and Lieutenant-Colonel Prevost
with part of the 67th, zealously supported their attack,
which was decisive in this part of the field. An eagle,
the first which the British had won, was taken. It belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
to the 8th regiment of light infantry, and bore a
gold collar round its neck, because that regiment had so
distinguished itself as to have received the thanks of
Buonaparte in person. The enemy were closely pursued
across a narrow valley, and a reserve, which they had
formed beyond it, was charged in like manner, and in
like manner put to the rout. General Dilkes was equally
successful on his side. Ruffin, confident in his numbers
and in his position, met him on the ascent. A bloody
contest ensued, but of no long duration, for the best
troops of France have never been able to stand against
the British bayonet. Ruffin was wounded and taken,
and the enemy driven from the heights in confusion. In
less than an hour and a half they were in full retreat,
and in that short time more than 4000 men had fallen, ...
for the British loss in killed and wounded amounted to
1243; not a single British soldier was taken. The
French loss was more than 3000. General Bellegrade
was killed, General Rousseau mortally wounded and
taken; the prisoners were only 440, because there was
no pursuit.</p>

<p>The 20th Portugueze regiment fought side by side
with the British in this memorable action. One squadron
of the German Legion, which had been attached to the
Spanish cavalry, joined in time to make a successful
charge against a squadron of French dragoons, which it
completely routed. General Whittingham, with the rest
of the cavalry, was engaged, meantime, in checking a
corps of horse and foot who were attempting to win the
height by the coast. The Walloon guards, and the
battalion of Ciudad Real, which had been attached to
Graham’s division, and had been left on the height,
made the greatest exertions to rejoin him; but it was
not possible for them to arrive before the victory was
decided, and the troops were too much exhausted to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
think of pursuing their advantage. They had been
marching for twenty hours before the battle.</p>

<p>The distance from Barrosa to Bermeja is about three
miles; Lapeña could not see what was passing at the
great scene of action, and an attack was made at the
same time upon Bermeja by Villatte, who had received
reinforcements from Chiclana: the enemy were vigorously
resisted there, and were called off by Victor in
consequence of his defeat. When the Spanish general
was informed of Graham’s brilliant action, he entertained
great hopes of succeeding in the farther movement which
had been intended. In the dispatch which he sent that
night to Cadiz, “The allied army,” he said, “had obtained
a victory so much the more satisfactory as circumstances
rendered it more difficult; but the valour of the
British and Spanish troops, the military skill and genius
of General Graham, and the gallantry of the commandant-general
of the vanguard, D. Jose Lardizabal, had
overcome all obstacles. I remain,” he continued, “master
of the enemy’s position, which is so important to me for
my subsequent operations.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Diversion on the coast.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But no attempt was made to profit by the bloody
victory which had been gained. General Graham
remained some hours upon the heights
which he had won, and as no supplies came to him, the
commissariat mules having been dispersed at the beginning
of the action, he left a small detachment there, and
then withdrew his troops, and early the next morning
crossed the Santi Petri. While he was on his march,
two landings were effected by way of diversion, between
Rota and Catalina, and between Catalina and Santa
Maria, by the marines of the British squadron, with
200 seamen and 80 Spanish marines: they stormed two
redoubts, and dismantled all the sea defences from Rota
to St. Maria, except Catalina. Preparations were made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
to attack the tete-du-pont and the bridge of St. Maria,
but the enemy advanced in force from Puerto Real, and
Sir Richard Keats, knowing that General Graham had
now re-entered the Isle of Leon, ordered the men to re-embark.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Cortes demand an inquiry.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Such was the lame and impotent conclusion of an
expedition which had been long prepared and
well concerted, in which the force employed
was adequate to the end proposed, and of which
every part that was attempted had been successfully
effected. General Graham complained loudly of Lapeña;
and the people of Cadiz, the Cortes, and the government,
were at first equally disposed to impute the failure
to the Spanish commander. The Cortes voted an address
to the Regency on the 9th, saying that the national
congress, not being able longer to endure the grief and
bitterness of seeing the circumstances of the expedition
remain in doubt and obscurity, requested the executive
government to give them, as speedily as possible, a circumstantial
account of the proceedings of the Spanish
army. When this account was laid before them, they
declared that the conduct of the general with regard to
the advantages which might have been obtained on the
memorable day of the battle was not sufficiently clear;
“the Cortes, therefore,” said they, “in discharge of its
sovereign mission, and using the supreme inspection
which it has reserved to itself over whatever may influence
the salvation of the kingdom, desires that the
council of Regency will immediately institute a scrupulous
investigation with all the rigour of military law.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Outcry in England against Lapeña.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>If such was at first the prevailing opinion in Cadiz, it
may well be supposed that the Spanish general
would be exposed to severe censure in England.
The story which obtained belief was, that Lapeña
and the Spaniards had been idle spectators of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
action, whereas, if they had only shown themselves upon
the adjoining heights, the French would have raised the
blockade, and retired in dismay to Seville; and that
after the battle, while he and 12,000 Spaniards remained
inactive, he sent to General Graham, whose troops were
without food, and had marched sixteen hours before they
came into action, desiring him to follow up the victory,
for that now was the time to deliver Cadiz. A vote of
thanks passed unanimously in both houses; but a few
days afterwards, when the ordnance estimates were before

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 1.</span><br />Speech of Mr. Ward.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the house, the honourable J. W. Ward said,
“he hoped he might now be allowed to ask for
some explanation of the deplorable misconduct
of our allies; for of that conduct it would be idle to
affect to speak in doubtful terms, it was reprobated with
equal indignation by all parties throughout the country.
Was it to be endured,” said he, “that while the British
troops were performing prodigies of valour in an unequal
contest, that those allies for whose independence they
were fighting, should stand by, cold-blooded spectators
of deeds, the bare recital of which should have been
enough to warm every man of them into a hero? If,
indeed, they had been so many mercenaries, and had
been hired to fight for a foreign power and in behalf of
a foreign cause; ... if they had been so many Swiss, ... in
that case their breach of duty, however culpable, would
have been less unaccountable, and perhaps more excusable;
but here, where they were allies bound to this
country in obligations greater than ever before one nation
owed to another ... our brave men lavishing those lives
which their country had so much better right to claim,
in defence of that cause in which those allies were
principals ... in such a case, tamely to look on while the
contest between numbers and bravery hung in doubtful
issue, ... this did appear to him to betray an indifference,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
an apathy, which, if he could suppose it to prevail among
the Spaniards, must render, in his mind, the cause of
Spanish independence altogether hopeless.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Perceval.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mr. Perceval replied, “that Mr. Ward had expressed
a stronger and more determined censure upon
the Spaniards than could be justified by any
evidence which had yet appeared. Had he expressed
his regret that the English had been left to fight the
battle alone, and had he required some explanation on
the subject, such conduct would have been perfectly
natural and right; but it was neither just nor generous
thus upon insufficient grounds to prejudice men who
were to undergo a legal investigation. General Graham’s
dispatches furnished no grounds for these sweeping
accusations; the Spanish troops which had been
attached to his division made every effort to come back
and join in the action; and when the situation of the
rest of the army, posted at four miles’ distance, was taken
into consideration, it required more information than
they possessed at present, even to justify the passing a
censure upon the whole Spanish army, or even upon any
part of it.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Whitbread.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mr. Whitbread now rose. “He should have been
glad,” he said, “to have joined in the general
expression of exultation when the vote of thanks
was passed; ... he should have been glad to have added
his mite to the general tribute in applause of the heroism
of that day, and to have claimed the hero of that day as
his much-valued friend. This he should have been
glad to have done, if he could have had sufficient control
over himself to have abstained from doing more. Mr.
Perceval had spoken like the advocate of the Spaniards;
they must be defended at all events, no matter how!
And what was it that was attempted to be defended?
The English army was on the point of being sacrificed ...<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
the Spaniards were in sight of them, within twenty
minutes quick march of them! and what did they?
What were they? Why, just what they have been described
by his honourable friend ... cold-blooded spectators
of the battle! After coldly witnessing a band of
heroes fighting and dying for their cause, General Lapeña
tells our small army, exhausted with its unparalleled
victory over numbers, that, forsooth, now was the time
to push its success. What did this redoubted general
mean? Was it insult, or treachery, or cowardice, ...
each, or all? He did not mean to complain of the
Spanish people, but of their officers. He should ever
think of Barrosa as a day memorable for the glory of
the Britons, and no less memorable for the infamy of the
Spaniards. Was it to be endured, that our brave fellows
should be so basely deserted, after an excessive night-march,
the moment they entered the field, against a foe
always formidable from discipline, and then doubly so
from numbers? Why were the two battalions withdrawn
from the heights of Barrosa? why was their
position abandoned precipitately to the French? who
gave this order but a Spanish officer? What! should
not this excite a jealousy? Was this the first time a
Spanish army had been cold-blooded spectators of
British heroism? Did they want this to remind them of
the stately indifference shown by Cuesta in the battle
of Talavera? Was all sound in Cadiz? Was there no
French party there? Were British armies never before
betrayed till the battle of Barrosa? He said betrayed,
for it was nothing less; the two battalions never came
up till our army had repulsed the French, beaten them
off, and was in hot pursuit of them as fast as our army
could pursue ... as fast as their exhausted limbs could
carry their noble hearts! Then what had been our
allies?... At Talavera nothing ... at Barrosa nothing ... or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
rather at both perhaps worse than nothing. The allied
force sailed from Cadiz ... the British fought ... the
Spaniards looked on. The British conquered; and yet
the siege was not raised. Again he asked, was all
sound at Cadiz? Was it true that General Graham had
been obstructed and foiled in all his plans ... that in the
midst of the fight, while the British troops were doing
feats which perhaps British troops alone could do,
their allies were doing what, he hoped, such men alone
were capable of ... plundering the British baggage? Was
this true? It was not the Spanish people he complained
of; he gave them every credit; but he gave their
leaders none. If all this was so, or nearly so, were the
British armies to be risked so worthlessly? Were they
to be abandoned to treachery or cowardice? For in
either or both must have originated the unnatural, ungrateful,
and infamous treatment they had met with.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Remarks on the failure of the expedition.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Whatever error of judgment General Lapeña might
have committed, the charges thus brought
against him and his army were as ill-founded
as they were intemperately urged. Instead of
being cold-blooded spectators of the battle, the main
body of the Spaniards were four miles distant; there
was a thick wood between them and the scene of action,
and they were themselves actually engaged at the time.
And it is worthy of remark, that while invectives, which
had no other tendency than to produce a breach between
England and Spain, were thus lavished upon the
Spaniards, by those politicians who would have had us
abandon Spain and Portugal to the tyrant’s pleasure,
the French were endeavouring to excite discontent between
the two countries by accusations which directly
contradicted these aspersions. Marshal Victor affirmed
in his official account, that when he determined to attack
the heights, the Spaniards under Lapeña were at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
time warmly engaged; the cannonade and the fire of
the musketry were extremely brisk, he said; and with
that falsehood which characterised the execrable system
of his government, he added, that the English, according
to their custom, had wished to place the Spaniards
in the post of danger, and expose themselves as little as
possible.</p>

<p>Lapeña prayed that an immediate inquiry should be
instituted, that the inquiry should be made public, and
that he should be punished if he were found culpable.
The inquiry was made, and the result was an honourable
acquittal. The proceedings were not published;
and unhappily the good opinion of the Spanish Government
afforded no proof, scarcely a presumption, of the
deserts of those on whom it was bestowed. At this
very time they appointed Mahy, who had done nothing
in Galicia, but oppress the inhabitants and paralyse the
efforts of a brave and willing population, to another
command; and Mendizabal, by whose misconduct their
best army had been destroyed, was sent to command in
the North. But though it cannot be inferred that
General Lapeña was not worthy of censure, because he
was pronounced free from fault, little investigation may
suffice to show that the outcry raised against him was
intemperate, if not altogether unjust, and that the failure
of the expedition was owing to the disagreement between
the British and Spanish generals, more than to any misconduct
on the part of the latter. Whether prudently
or not, General Graham had consented to act under
Lapeña; and whether the plan of operations was well
concerted or not, he had assented to it. That plan was,
that the allies should open a communication with the
Isle of Leon, by breaking through the left of the
enemy’s line; this being done, they would receive supplies
and reinforcements, and might proceed to farther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
successes. It had never been intended in this plan that
the British should turn back to attack a part of the
French army, whose numbers were, to their own, in the
proportion of two to one, and who had every advantage
of ground; nor that they should cripple themselves by
fighting upon ground, where mere honour was all that
could be gained. The memorial which Lapeña addressed
to the Cortes, praying for an inquiry into his
conduct, contains his justification. “He had assured
General Graham,” he says, “on the evening after the
battle, that the troops from the isle should come out,
and that provisions should be sent to the English; and
it was with extreme surprise he learned that they had
retreated without his knowledge.” The cause of this
movement is perfectly explicable; the Spaniards in
Cadiz and the island, never very alert in their movements,
were not ready with an immediate supply of
provisions, and the British troops after the battle were
neither in a humour, nor in a state, nor in a situation to
wait patiently till it should arrive. From this moment
all co-operation was at an end. When the Spanish
general applied to his own Government, and to General
Graham, respecting farther operations, the former told
him that they had written to the British ambassador,
and were waiting for his answer; the latter that he was
not in a condition to come out of the isle again, but that
he would cover the points of the line of defence.
Lapeña thus found himself deprived of that part of the
allied force upon whose skill and discipline his best
hopes of success must have been founded; “had he
acted for himself,” he said, “he would have pursued the
enemy with the Spanish troops alone, but he was under
the necessity of consulting the Government which was
so close at hand.” This alone would have occasioned
delay; but Lapeña was at that moment under a charge<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
of misconduct preferred against him by the British, and
echoed by the people and the Cortes; and thus in
delays, formalities, and examinations, the irrecoverable
hours were lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Death of Alburquerque.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It must have added to the grief of the true Spaniards
in Cadiz upon this occasion, when they remembered
that they might at this day have had a
general who had every claim to the confidence of his
men, his government, and his allies, that distinguished
services, unbounded sacrifices, enterprise, talents, and
devoted patriotism could give. That general, the
Duque de Alburquerque, whose name will ever be
regarded as the most illustrious of his illustrious line,
had just at this time fallen a victim to the malignity of
the Junta of Cadiz. After remaining in England eight
months in a state of exile, intolerable to one who was
as capable as he was desirous of serving his country
in the field, he printed a statement of his conduct and
case, which he had withheld as long as any possible
injury could be apprehended from its publication.
This he sent to the Cortes; it was received as the
merits of its author deserved; eulogiums never more
justly merited were heard from all sides; the Cortes
declared that the duke and his army had deserved well
of their country, particularly for preserving the Isle of
Leon and Cadiz, and they desired that the Regency
would recall him from England that he might again
be actively employed. In consequence of this, he
was appointed to the command in Galicia. The Junta
of Cadiz, however, acting as they had done in other
cases, even of greater importance, in contempt of the
Government, drew up a reply to his statement; it
was addressed to the duke, and with insolence equal
to their ingratitude, and falsehood if possible surpassing
both, they called him, in direct terms, an impudent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
calumniator and an enemy to his country. Each of the
members of this body signed it individually; it was
printed as a hand-bill, and a copy of it was sent to
London by some private hand, and reached Alburquerque
through the twopenny post, that no possible mark of
insult might be wanting to the transaction.</p>

<p>Alburquerque ought to have despised any attack
from that quarter, and more especially one which, by
its intemperance and scurrility, so plainly showed in
what vile passions it had originated. But he wore his
heart for daws to peck at, and his enemies knew but
too well the infirmity of his nature. At first he endeavoured
to repress or to conceal his feelings, and drew
up a short and dignified representation to the Cortes;
but this did not satisfy him; notwithstanding the
earnest dissuasions of his friends, he determined upon
replying to the Junta, and he devoted himself to this
composition with an earnestness which made him forgetful
both of food and of sleep. Three days were thus
employed in a state of restless and feverish anxiety.
The wound all this while was rankling, and the venom
of the Junta did its work. On the fourth day a frenzy-fever
seized him; he felt the approach of the disease,
and was perfectly sensible of the cause, for having sent
for D. J. M. Blanco White, he took from his pocket, as
soon as he saw him, a strip of paper on which he had
written, “<i>como calumniador y enemigo de la patria</i>,”
... the words which had stung him to the heart, ... and
said, “When they ask why I have lost my senses, this
paper will answer for me.” ... A dreadful scene ensued;
fits of tears were followed by paroxysms of rage, and on
the third day of his illness he expired: happily in the
course of the disease the sense of his own wrongs,
intolerable and fatal as it had proved, gave way to a
deeper feeling: he forgot himself in thinking of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
country: his repeated exclamations of vengeance upon
Napoleon Buonaparte were so vehement and loud that
they were distinctly heard by the passers in the street;
and his last breath was spent in imprecations upon the
tyrant whose wickedness had caused all the unutterable
miseries of Spain. Every public honour which the
British Government could bestow was paid to the remains
of this illustrious man, and his body was deposited
in that same vault in Henry VII.’s chapel
wherein Marlborough’s had formerly been laid, till it
could be sent home, to rest with his ancestors<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">It</span> was now made apparent, as well by the battle of
Barrosa, as by the whole conduct of the Cortes, that
no successful exertions were to be expected on that
side; and that, though the subjugation of the Peninsula
could not but appear every day more hopeless to the
Intruder’s government, all reasonable hope of its deliverance
must rest upon Lord Wellington, and the allied
army under his command. Thus far his foresight had
been fully approved by the issue of Massena’s invasion;
that general had entered Portugal with 72,000 men,
and had received reinforcements to the amount of about
15,000 more: ten he had lost at Busaco; about as
many more had died while he perseveringly maintained
his ground; and what with prisoners, sick and wounded,
and the losses on the retreat, about 40,000 only were
remaining when he recrossed the frontier. The invaders
had lost their horses, carriages, ammunition,
and cannon; but for this they cared not; they had the
strong hold of Ciudad Rodrigo on which to retire; and
even the wreck of their army was more numerous than
the force which drove them out of Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Opinions of the opposition writers at this time.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During these events, the opponents of the English
ministry improved with more than their wonted
infelicity the opportunity afforded them of exhibiting
their errors in judgment, their want of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
that knowledge which is the foundation of political
wisdom, and their destitution of that generous feeling
which sometimes renders even error respectable. When
the first news arrived that the French were breaking up
from their position, they cautioned the public against
extravagant expectations; “such accounts,” they said,
“have come too often to raise enthusiasm in any but
simpletons and stock-jobbers; and there seems no reason
for altering the opinion which we have so often
expressed, that, happen what may partially, the ultimate
loss of the Peninsula is as certain as ever it was, and
that we are only delaying the catastrophe by needless
proofs of a valour, which our enemies admire much more
than our allies. In the meantime, Spain does nothing,
except calumniate and kill her exiled patriots; and
reasonable people have long ceased to look to any place
but South America for the resuscitation of Spanish independence.”</p>

<p>When it was known beyond all doubt to those whose
belief was not influenced by their wishes, that Massena
was in full retreat and Lord Wellington pursuing him,
“these retreats and pursuits,” said they, “are fine
things for tickling the ears. Most probably the retreat
is, as usual, an alteration of position; and the pursuit a
little look-out on the occasion, enlivened by the seizure
of a few unfortunate stragglers.” At the discovery that
this change of position was from the Zezere to the
Agueda, ... nothing less than the evacuation of Portugal,
... the despondents were neither abashed nor silenced.
“Buonaparte’s honour,” they said, “was pledged to
effect his projects in the Peninsula, and unfortunately
his power was as monstrous as his ambition. Massena
would now throw himself upon his resources both in
men and provisions; he was removing from a ravaged
and desolate country, to one comparatively uninjured<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
and fertile; and it was to be remarked, that while the
French were falling back upon their supplies, the allies
were removing from their own. In such a state of
things, could Lord Wellington’s army long exist on the
frontiers? The war had become one of supplies and
expenses; if the enemy could establish large magazines
at Almeida, they could again advance, the same scenes
would again be repeated, and Lisbon would again become
the point of defence. The result must certainly
be determined by the success or ill success of the French
in Spain. If Spain falls,” said they, “nothing short of a
miracle can preserve Portugal; and that Spain will fall,
is almost as certain as that her people are self-willed
and superstitious, her nobility divided and degraded, and
her commanders incapable, arrogant, or treacherous.”
We were, moreover, warned by these sapient politicians,
to remember, that there were seven marshals
in Spain, besides generals, with distinct commands;
and that the French, having retired upon their resources,
had only abandoned Portugal for the season,
that they might return and reap the harvest which
they had left the natives to sow. It was not enough
to dismay the nation by thus prognosticating what the
French would do, they threw out alarming hints of
what, even now, it was to be apprehended they might
have done. “If,” said they, “Massena had received
adequate reinforcements from France, the positions
which he took at Guarda and Almeida would have
drawn the allies into a most dangerous predicament;
and let us imagine what might at this very instant be
the perilous situation of Lord Wellington, if a considerable
army had really been collected under Bessieres!”
Happy was it for England, that the councils of this
country were not directed by men who would have verified
their own predictions, leaving the enemy unresisted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
as far as Great Britain was concerned, because they
believed him to be irresistible!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Address of the Portugueze Government to the people.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But while the factious part of the British press was
thus displaying how far it was possible for men
to deaden their hearts against all generous emotions,
the Portugueze governors were expressing
their gratitude to England for the effectual support
which she had given to her old ally. They told
the people that their day of glory was at length arrived;
they had passed through the fiery ordeal, by which the
merits of men were tried and purified; they were become
a great nation. “Humbling themselves,” they
said, “before the first and sovereign Author of all good,
they rendered thanks to their Prince, for establishing, in
his wisdom, the basis of their defence; ... to his British
majesty, to his enlightened ministry, and to the whole
British nation, in whom they had found faithful and
liberal allies, constant co-operation, and that honour,
probity, and steadiness of principle, which peculiarly
distinguished the British character; ... to the illustrious
Wellington, whose sagacity and consummate military
skill had been so eminently displayed; ... to the zealous
and indefatigable Beresford, who had restored discipline
and organization to the Portugueze troops; ... to the
generals and officers, and their comrades in arms, who
had never fought that they did not triumph; ... finally,
to the whole Portugueze people, whose loyalty, patriotism,
constancy, and humanity, had been so gloriously
displayed, during the season of danger and of suffering.”
“Portugueze,” said they, “the effects of the invasion
of these barbarians; the yet smoking remains of the
cottage of the poor, of the mansion of the wealthy, of the
cell of the religious, of the hospital which afforded shelter
and relief to the indigent and infirm, of the temples<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
dedicated to the worship of the Most High; the innocent
blood of so many peaceful citizens of both sexes,
and of all ages, with which those heaps of ruins are still
tinged; the insults of every kind heaped upon those
whom the Vandals did not deprive of life ... insults
many times more cruel than death itself; the universal
devastation, the robbery and destruction of everything
that the unhappy inhabitants of the invaded districts
possessed: ... this atrocious scene, which makes humanity
shudder, affords a terrible lesson, which you
ought deeply to engrave in memory, in order fully to
know that degenerate nation, who retain only the figure
of men, and who in every respect are worse than beasts,
and more blood-thirsty than tigers or lions; who are
without faith and without law; who acknowledge neither
the rights of humanity, nor respect the sacred tie
of an oath.”</p>

<p>They proceeded to speak with becoming feeling and
becoming pride of the manner in which the emigrants
from the ravaged provinces had been received wherever
they had fled. The great expense of subsisting the
fugitives at Lisbon had been supported, they said, by
the resources which were at the disposal of Government,
but still more by the voluntary donations of individuals,
among whom they mentioned with particular distinction,
the British subjects in Portugal. It remained for completing
the work, to restore the fugitives to their homes;
to render habitable the towns which the barbarians had
left covered with filth and unburied carcases; to relieve
with medicine and food the sick, who were perishing for
want of such assistance; to revive agriculture, by supplying
the husbandman with seed corn, and bread for his
consumption for some time, and facilitating his means of
purchasing cattle and acquiring the instruments of agriculture.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
These, they said, were the constant cares of the
Government, these were their duties; but their funds
were not even sufficient to provide for their defence, and
therefore they called upon individuals for further aid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Wellington asks relief for the suffering Portugueze.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lord Wellington in the preceding autumn, as soon as
he fell back to the lines of Torres Vedras, had
represented to his own Government the distress
to which those districts must be reduced through
which the enemy passed, ... a distress which
Portugal had no means of relieving. “Upon
former occasions,” he said, “the wealthy inhabitants of
Great Britain, and of London in particular, had stepped
forward to relieve foreign nations, whether suffering
under the calamities inflicted by Providence, or by a
cruel and powerful enemy. Portugal had once before
experienced such a proof of friendship from her oldest
and most faithful ally: but never was there case in
which this assistance was required in a greater degree
than at present, whether the sufferings of the people, or
their loyalty and patriotism, and their attachment to
England, were considered. I declare,” said Lord Wellington,
“that I have scarcely known an instance in
which any person in Portugal, of any order, has had
communication with the enemy, inconsistent with his
duty to his own sovereign, or with the orders he had
received. There is no instance of the inhabitants of
any town or village having remained, or of their having
failed to remove what might be useful to the enemy,
when they had sufficiently early intimation of the wishes
of Government, or of myself, that they should abandon
their houses, and carry away their property.” He therefore
recommended this brave and suffering people to the
British Government, and the British people, whenever
the country should be cleared of its barbarous invaders,
as he hoped and trusted that it would.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 8.</span><br />Parliamentary grant for the relief of the Portugueze.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>That hope had now been accomplished: his letter
was laid before Parliament, and a message from
the Prince Regent was presented, stating, “That,
having taken into consideration the distress to
which the inhabitants of a part of Portugal had
been exposed, in consequence of the invasion of
that country, and especially from the wanton and savage
barbarity exercised by the French in their recent retreat,
which could not fail,” he said, “to affect the hearts of
all persons who had any sense of religion or humanity,
he desired to be enabled to afford to the suffering subjects
of his Majesty’s good and faithful ally, such speedy
and effectual relief as might be suitable to this interesting
and afflicting occasion.” Accordingly a grant of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marquis Wellesley.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

100,000<i>l.</i> was proposed; Marquis Wellesley
saying, when he moved an address to this effect,
“he hoped he had not lived to see the day, though he
had sometimes been surprised by hearing something
like it, when it should be said that ancient faith, long-tried
attachment, and close connexion with our allies,
were circumstances to be discarded from our consideration,
and that they should be sacrificed and abandoned
to the mere suggestions and calculations of a cold

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Earl Grosvenor.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

policy.” Earl Grosvenor was the only person
who demurred at this motion. “He felt considerable
difficulty in acceding to it,” he said, “particularly
when he considered how much had been done
already for Portugal, and he would ask whether their
lordships were really prepared to take the whole burden
upon themselves, and exempt the Portugueze altogether
from the charge of relieving their own countrymen? It
was a principle as applicable to public as to private
affairs, that you should be just to your own people before

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marquis of Lansdowne.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

you were generous to other nations.” The Marquis
of Lansdowne spoke in a better mind: “Whatever,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
said, “might have been his opinion regarding the
policy of our exertions in Portugal, no doubt existed
with him, that the efforts made by the
people of Portugal eminently deserved at our hands the
aid now asked, to relieve that distress into which they
had been plunged by the enemy. Even, therefore, if he
believed that Lord Wellington would be again compelled
to retreat, still he would vote for the present motion,
convinced that it could not fail to make an impression
in Europe highly favourable to the British character,
by displaying its beneficence, its generosity, and its
humanity, as contrasted with the savage barbarity of the
enemy. In extending to the people of Portugal that
generosity for which they might look through Europe
and the world in vain, we placed our national character
upon a pinnacle of greatness which nothing could destroy.
Even if our army was compelled to evacuate
Portugal, and we should be unable to withstand there
the progress of the French, still the posterity of the inhabitants
of Portugal would remember with gratitude
the aid afforded to their ancestors in the hour of their
distress. For these reasons, the address should have
his hearty concurrence.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Ponsonby.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mr. Ponsonby in like manner, when the vote was
moved in the Commons, declared, “that it was
not less due to the spirit of Portugal, than to
the magnanimity of Great Britain, ... that it was as consistent
with our interest, as it was material to our
honour. The only regret,” said he, “with which it is
accompanied on my part, proceeds from the reflection,
that the vast expenditure of this country should render
it necessary to limit the vote to so small a sum.” But
the liberality of the British people has seldom been more
conspicuously displayed, than in the subscriptions which
were made on this occasion. About 80,000<i>l.</i> was subscribed.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
The public grant was to be measured, not by

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Public subscription.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the necessities of the Portugueze sufferers, but
by the means of the British Government; and
the Prince of Brazil called it “a most ample donation,
entirely corresponding to the generosity with which a
great nation and its Government had assisted Portugal.”
The individual proofs of beneficence were acknowledged
in the most honourable manner; the Prince issued an
order, that the list of subscribers should be printed at
the royal printing-office, and copies sent to the chambers
of each of the suffering districts, where, having been
publicly read after mass, they should be laid up in the
<i>Cartorios</i>, or archives of the respective districts; the
original list was to be deposited among the royal archives
in the Torre do Tombo at Lisbon, “that the
humanity of the one nation,” said the Prince, “and the
gratitude of the other may be attested to future generations.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distribution of the grant.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The <i>dezembargador</i>, Joam Gaudencio Torres, and Mr.
Croft (one of a family which had been long
established at Porto, and who was subsequently
attached to the British legation) accepted the charge of
distributing this grant, and for that purpose, of visiting
the districts which had been ravaged, and seeing in
person to the distribution. It required no common
degree of humanity, and no ordinary strength of heart,
to undertake so painful an office. The time, it may be
hoped, is approaching, when the usages of war will as
little be admitted before man, as a plea for having
destroyed the innocent and the helpless, as it will
before God. Massena had gone to the utmost limits of
that dreadful plea before he broke up from his position.
Opposite to the house in which he had fixed his own
quarters at Santarem were the ruins of a church, into
which a number of wretched children, whose parents<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
had perished, and who were themselves perishing for
hunger, had crept, that they might lie down and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Children famished at Santarem.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

die. They were found there by the first British
troops who entered the town, stretched upon
straw and rubbish ... the dying and the dead together,
reduced to skeletons before they died. When the
officer, who relates this in his journal, saw them, pieces
of bread which our soldiers had given these poor
orphans were lying untouched before many who were
incapable of eating, and some who had breathed their
last. Multitudes, indeed, had been famished before he
abandoned his hopes of conquest; but for the subsequent
conduct of that merciless general and his army
no military motives can be assigned ... none but what
are purely malignant and devilish. Marshal Massena
had formerly declared, that if he could land with an
army in England, he would pledge himself, not indeed
to effect the conquest of the country, but to reduce it to
a desert. In Portugal it was proved that out of the
wickedness of his heart his lips had then spoken; for on
his retreat, he endeavoured, in perfect conformity with
the political system of his emperor, to increase by every
possible means the horrors of war and the sum of human
suffering. The cruelties which were perpetrated by that
retreating army formed but a little part of the evils they
inflicted upon the brave nation which had successfully

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>State in which the French left the country they had occupied.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

resisted them; and in the districts which they
devastated, the inhabitants who perished under
their hands were less to be compassionated than
those who survived. The famine which they
intentionally produced, by destroying every thing in the
course of their retreat and within reach of their power,
continued to depopulate the country long after it was
delivered from its enemies. Endemic diseases were
produced by want of food and of raiment, by exposure,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
by grief, and hopeless wretchedness. The hospitals,
with which Portugal abounded, had shared the general
destruction: many had been burnt, others gutted, the
resources of all destroyed; and those of the clergy and
of the convents, to which the sufferers would otherwise
have looked for aid, and from which they would have
found it, were in like manner totally dilapidated. The
income of the Bishop of Leyria was reduced from
40,000 <i>cruzados</i> to forty; and others had suffered
in a like degree. In that district the population was
cut down by the barbarities of the enemy, by famine,
and by disease, from 48,000 to 16,000; and in the subdivision

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pombal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of Pombal from 7000 to 1800. Two
hundred families in the town of Pombal derived
before the invasion a comfortable subsistence from husbandry;
after the retreat an hundred and sixty-four of
those families had totally disappeared; and the few
survivors of the remaining thirty-six were suffering
under famine and disease. In a principal street of
that poor town the commissioners found one dismantled
dwelling, standing alone in the midst of ruins, and containing
three wretched inhabitants. Such was the desolation
which this more than barbarous enemy had left
behind them, that in what had been the populous and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Santarem.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

flourishing town of Santarem, the screech owls
took possession of a whole street of ruins, where
it seemed as if man had been employed in reducing
human edifices to a state which rendered them fit receptacles
for birds and beasts of prey. The number of
these birds, and the boldness with which the havoc everywhere
about inspired them, made it frightful to pass that
way even in the daytime; insomuch, that a soldier who
had been promoted for his personal bravery was known
more than once to forego his mess, rather than pass
to it through these ruins. Dogs who were now without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
owners preyed upon the dead. Wolves fed on human

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Leyria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

bodies in the streets of Leyria; and retaining
then no longer their fear of man, attacked the
living who came in their way. The servant of an English
gentleman was pursued one evening by two, in the outskirts
of that city; he escaped from them only by climbing
a single olive tree, which, happily for him, had
been left standing; it was just high enough to afford
him security, yet so low that the wolves besieged him in
it all night; three or four others joined them in the
blockade, and when he was seen and rescued in the
morning, the bark as high as they could reach had been
scored by their repeated endeavours to spring up and
seize him.</p>

<p>There were parts of the country where the people,
having no other sustenance, allayed the pain of emptiness
without supplying the wants of nature, by eating boiled
grass, which they seasoned, such as could, with the
brine and scales left in the baskets from which salt fish,
or sardinhas had been sold, these being at that time the
scarce and almost only remaining articles of food. Among
a people in this extreme distress, the commissioners had
the painful task of selecting the cases which could bear
no deferment of relief, when every case was urgent,
when multitudes were perishing for want, and when the
whole amount of the means of relief at their disposal,
economized as those means were to the utmost, was deplorably
inadequate to the just and pressing claims upon
it. Eighteen months after the retreat, the price of provisions
in the wasted provinces was about six times
higher than before the invasion; a fact from which some
conception may be formed of the misery endured in the
course of those months, and of the state of things when
the commissioners entered upon their arduous and painful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
task. Inadequate to this dreadful necessity as the
aid of England was, yet, while it is to be feared a greater
number perished for want of human, or of timely help,
43,000 sick and 8000 orphans were saved by it. The
relief was not bestowed in food alone, and in the means
of removal, but in the means of future subsistence ...
cows, oxen, implements of agriculture, and seed of
various kinds. The gratitude of the people, to their
honour it should be said, was more in proportion to the
intention and good-will which were thus manifested,
than to the actual relief which was afforded. And if in
Portugal, as there would have been in any other country,
men were found whose hearts were so hard and their
consciences so stupified that they sought only how to
make the necessities and miseries of their fellow-creatures
an occasion of lucre for themselves, it may safely
be asserted, that never in any public calamity was there
less of such wicked selfishness displayed than at this
time. The commissioners who were employed ten
months upon this service, (which was not less hazardous
than painful, for it exposed them continually to contagious
disease as well as to the constant sight of suffering),
performed their office gratuitously, and would not
consent to have their personal expenses reimbursed: the
secretary and assistants who always accompanied them
refused to accept any pecuniary recompense for their
time and labour: and the house of the Vanzellers of
Porto advanced money for purchasing great part of the
cattle, and would receive no commission whatever upon
the negociation and payment of the bills. A brother of
that house, while the allied army occupied the lines, received
under his own roof at Lisbon, and at his own cost
maintained more than forty refugees, who were all personally
unknown to him before that time: and at his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
mother’s<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> country house near Porto, as many as came
daily were fed in her own presence, from seventy to an
hundred and upwards being the usual number. It is
consolatory to record such examples in a history where
so many errors and crimes must be recorded. When
the distribution was completed, the Portugueze Regency
assured the British Government that there did not
appear to have been a single complaint against the
justice and regularity with which it had been made, and
that this scrupulous and efficient application of the grant
to the ends intended was owing to the unwearied exertion
of Mr. Croft and his colleagues: they added,
that they should lay those high services, as they properly
denominated them, before the Prince of Brazil,
and expressed their desire that Mr. Croft’s conduct
might be made known to the Prince Regent of Great
Britain. That gentleman was, in consequence, created
a Baronet, and received the royal Portugueze order of
the Tower and Sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Political effect of the distribution.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>No measure could have had the effect of inspiring
the Portugueze people with so much confidence,
as this public distribution of seed corn, and
tools, and cattle. They who had been most
apprehensive of another invasion, were convinced that
Great Britain would not have conferred such a gift, if
what was now bestowed upon them were likely to be
wrested from them by the enemy; and under that conviction
they resumed in hope those labours, from which
despair might otherwise have deterred them. But it was
far from Lord Wellington’s intention to deceive them
into any fallacious opinion of their own security; on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
contrary, his first thought, after he had driven the
French beyond the frontier, was to warn the Portugueze
that the danger might yet be renewed. “Their nation,”
he said, “had still riches left, which the tyrant would
endeavour to plunder: they were happy under a beneficent
sovereign, and this alone would make him exert
himself to destroy their happiness: they had successfully
resisted him, and therefore he would leave no possible
means unemployed for bringing them under his iron
yoke.” He appealed to all who had witnessed the
successive invasions of Junot, Soult, and Massena,
whether the system of the French had not been to confiscate,
to plunder, and to commit every outrage which
their atrocious dispositions could devise? and whether
from the general, to the lowest soldier, they had not
delighted in the practice of such excesses? “The
Portugueze,” he said, “ought not to relax their preparations
for resistance. Every man capable of bearing
arms ought to learn the use of them: those who, by
their age or sex, were not capable of taking the field,
should beforehand look out for places of safety where
they might retire in time of need: they should bury
their most valuable effects, every one in secret, not
trusting the knowledge of the place to those who had
no interest in concealing it: and they should take means
for effectually concealing, or destroying the food, which,
in case of necessity, could not be removed. If,” said
Lord Wellington, “these measures are adopted, however
superior in number the force may be which the
desire of plunder and of vengeance may induce the
tyrant to send again for the invasion of this country, the
issue will be certain, and the independence of Portugal
will be finally established, to the eternal honour of the
present generation.” Having issued this proclamation,
and made arrangements for the blockade of Almeida,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Lord Wellington, leaving his army under Sir Brent
Spencer, took advantage of the temporary inaction of
the enemy to go into Alentejo.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marquis Beresford goes to Alentejo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Beresford had accompanied the commander-in-chief
in pursuit of the retreating enemy, as far as the
Ceyra. There Lord Wellington received news
as unexpected as it was unwelcome, that Badajoz
had been surrendered by its base governor. Another
piece of intelligence distressed him; a Spanish
officer of rank and ability, who had arranged the correspondence
which was carried on with his countrymen
in those parts of Spain possessed by the French, had
been made prisoner in the route of Mendizabal’s army,
and immediately entered the Intruder’s service. Lord
Wellington acted with characteristic sagacity on this
occasion; neither treating, nor considering this person
as wholly reprobate because he had shown a want of
principle which proceeded from want of courage to endure
adversity, he caused a letter to be written to him,
containing a hint, that bad as his conduct was, it would
be his own fault if he made it unforgiveable. The hint
was taken as it was meant; ... for the motive of ingratiating
himself with his new patrons was not strong
enough to overpower a natural humanity, a remaining
sense of honour, and a prudential consideration of the
instability of fortune: the officer kept his secret, and
lived to be well rewarded for having done so. The
surrender of Badajoz, which left the besieging army at
liberty to act against the allies wherever they might
deem best, divided Lord Wellington’s attention, and
checked him in what else would have been a career of
victory: but while he continued the pursuit of the retreating
army, he sent the Marshal to his command on
the south of the Tagus, to provide against the consequences
which might result from Imaz’s baseness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Valencia de Alcantara, Albuquerque, and Campo Mayor taken by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mortier, meantime, not failing to pursue to the utmost
the advantage which that misconduct had given
him, advanced upon Valencia de Alcantara, Albuquerque,
and Campo Mayor, in order that
the troops which he knew would be sent against
him might be deprived of those points of support.
The first of these places had long ceased
to be of any importance as a fortress; it was taken by
surprise, and seven brass guns, being the whole of its
artillery, were destroyed for want of carriages. Latour
Maubourg went against Albuquerque; its fortress, a
century ago, had been called impregnable; and might
now have made some defence, relief being so near at
hand; but the appearance of an enemy and a few cannon-shot
sufficed to terrify the garrison; they surrendered
without resistance, and were sent prisoners to
Badajoz with seventeen brass guns of large calibre:
the French then razed the works. While these detachments
were thus successfully employed, Mortier himself

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 22.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

opened the trenches before Campo Mayor: this fortress
resisted better than its Castilian neighbours had
done; a battalion of militia incurred some disgrace
by its conduct, but the spirit of the inhabitants
and the governor was excellent, and the place held out
eleven days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beresford arrives on the frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The fall of Campo Mayor was regretted, more for the
sake of its brave defenders than for any advantage
that could accrue to the enemy from a conquest
which they could not maintain. Marshal
Beresford arrived at Chamusca during the siege, and on
the day that it surrendered, assembled his corps at
Portalegre, now strengthened by the 4th division, and
Colonel de Gray’s brigade of heavy cavalry. On the
24th, everything was collected at and in front of Arronches;
and on the following day he moved against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
the Campo Mayor, meaning, if the enemy should persist
in retaining it, to interpose between that town and
Badajoz. The main body of the French had by this
time returned to the Caya, the whole of their besieging
train had re-entered Badajoz, they had removed thither
the heavy guns from Campo Mayor, and Soult had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Affair near Campo Mayor.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

given orders to destroy the works there, which
were prevented by the appearance of Marshal
Beresford’s corps. About a league from the
town, the allies fell in and skirmished with the enemy’s
advanced horse: and Brigadier-General Long advancing
rapidly with the cavalry, came up with their whole
force, which, upon perceiving his movements, had evacuated
the place, and was retiring towards Badajoz. It
consisted of eight squadrons of cavalry, and two battalions
of infantry, commanded by General Latour Maubourg;
the latter were retreating in column with two
troops of hussars at their head and two closing their
rear, the rest manœuvring so as at once to cover the
retreat of the foot, and secure to themselves its support:
upon the approach of the allies, the French infantry
formed an oblong square, and the horse took up a
position <i>en potence</i>. Long’s first object was to dispose
of their cavalry; he ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Head,
with the 13th dragoons, to attack in flank the three
squadrons which were on the same line with the infantry;
while he, with three Portugueze squadrons,
attacked in front the three which formed the angle to
the right of the others: Colonel Elder, with two squadrons
of Portugueze, was to cover his left, and turn the
enemy’s right; and eight squadrons of heavy dragoons
to support the attack. As soon as Head advanced, the
enemy changed their position, brought forward their
right, and met the charge; they were immediately
broken, and in their flight carried away with them the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
other squadrons, which, from the change of position, had
in some measure become a second line. From Campo
Mayor to Badajoz is an open plain without tree or bush;
over this ground the French retreated rapidly, skirmishing
the whole way. The 13th pursued with ungovernable
eagerness, and the two squadrons of Portugueze
which were sent to their support caught the same spirit,
and dispersed in the heat of pursuit. In this affair,
there were many opportunities for the display of individual
courage and dexterity. Colonel Chamorin, of the
26th French dragoons, was encountered by a corporal of
the 13th, whose comrade he had just before shot through
the head; each was a master of his horse and weapon,
but at length the corporal, striking off the helmet of his
enemy with one blow, cleft his head down to the ears
with another.</p>

<p>The heavy cavalry, meantime, had been halted two
miles off, and there only remained with General Long
three squadrons of Portugueze with which to harass and
impede the French infantry, till it could be brought up:
these Portugueze did not stand the fire of the column
and the appearance of the hussars; and though they
were soon rallied, the retreating column gained ground
considerably before the heavy cavalry could overtake
them. The 13th and the two Portugueze squadrons
were then perceived returning from the pursuit which
they had followed with such heedless precipitation, as
to have given the enemy the superiority of numbers, and
to have lost twenty-four killed, seventy wounded, and
seventy-seven prisoners: some of them had pushed on
to the very gate of Badajoz, and were taken on the
bridge. Marshal Beresford would not risk the loss of
more cavalry, and the enemy’s column therefore retired
unmolested, retaking fifteen out of sixteen guns which
our 13th had taken. The loss of the French was very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
considerable; in one of their regiments only six officers
out of sixteen remained for duty. The next morning a
French captain of dragoons came with a trumpet, demanding
permission to search the field for his colonel.
Several of our officers went out with him. The peasants
had stripped the dead during the night; and more
than six hundred naked bodies were lying on the
ground, mostly slain with sabre wounds. It was long
before they could find Chamorin, lying on his face in
his clotted blood: as soon as the body was turned up,
the French captain gave a sort of scream, sprung off his
horse, threw off his brazen helmet, and kneeling by the
body, took the lifeless hand, and kissed it repeatedly
with a passionate grief which affected all the beholders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Measures concerted with the Spaniards.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>After this affair Beresford cantoned his troops at Campo
Mayor, Elvas, Borba, and Villa-Viçosa: they
were equally in need of rest and of refitment,
great part of the British infantry having made
forced marches from Condeixa, and being in want of shoes.
General Ballasteros, who was seldom at any time in
force without suffering defeat, and never defeated without
presently obtaining some success, after experiencing
some of these customary alternations, and incurring some
severe losses in the Condado de Niebla, had fallen back
upon Gibraleon, hoping to effect a junction with Zayas,
who had been sent from Cadiz with 6000 men, of whom
400 were cavalry. Something was always to be expected
from Ballasteros’s remarkable activity; but there
was equal reason for dreading the effect of his incaution:
by Beresford’s request, therefore, Castaños wrote
to desire that he and Zayas would not commit themselves,
but reserve their force entire for co-operating
with him. Beresford’s objects at this time were, to
throw a bridge across the Guadiana at Jurumenha, ... to
recover Olivença, drive Mortier out of Extremadura,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
and form as soon as possible the siege of Badajoz. Foreseeing
the want of a bridge, Lord Wellington had frequently,
before the fall of that place, urged the Spanish
general officers to remove the bridge-boats, and other

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

materials which were in store there, to Elvas. They began
to follow this advice, but so late and so slowly,
that only five of the twenty boats had been removed,
when Mendizabal’s defeat rendered any further
removal impossible: these, when laid down, left 160 yards
of the river uncovered. Nor was this the only difficulty.
It had been supposed that ample supplies had been collected
at Estremoz and Villa Viçosa; but owing to the
poverty of the Government, and to that mismanagement
which, from the highest to the lowest of its departments,
prevailed and was maintained, as if by prescriptive
right, throughout, not enough were found to ensure the
subsistence of the troops from day to day. Moreover, there
were no shoes in store for an army which had marched
itself barefoot. And had there been no deficiency of
stores, and no previous difficulties to overcome, Beresford’s
force, consisting of 20,000 effective men, British
and Portugueze, was inadequate to the operations which
he was to undertake with it, though it was the utmost
that Lord Wellington could spare from the more immediately
important scene of action on the frontier of
Beira.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bridge constructed at Jurumenha.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Nothing, however, that could be done by diligence
and exertion was omitted. The Guadiana was
in such a state that it seemed feasible to construct
a bridge by fixing trestles across the
shallow part of the river, and connecting them with the
five Spanish boats in the deeper stream; or those boats
might be used as a floating bridge for the artillery and
heavy stores, and the interval filled with some half
dozen tin pontoons, which had been sent from Lisbon to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Elvas, and which, though weak and bad of their kind,
might bear the weight of infantry, there being a practicable
ford for the horse. This latter plan was preferred:
materials were collected not without great
difficulty, and delays which that difficulty occasioned:
trees were to be felled for the purpose, and the trestles
were made only seven feet in height, because no timber
for making larger was found near the spot. On the
2nd of April the engineers reported that the passage
was ready for the following day, and three squadrons
passed that evening, and stretched their piquets along
the advanced hills; thus making a show which imposed
upon the enemy. The troops marched from their cantonments,
and arrived at daybreak in a wood within a
mile of the bridge. No apprehensions of the river
had been entertained, for there had been no rain in
those parts; but heavy rains had fallen far off, in the
high regions where the Guadiana has its sources. When
day broke it was seen that the water had risen three
feet seven inches in the course of the night: planks,
trestles, and pontoons were swept away by the current,
and the ford also had become impassable. Beresford
still determined to cross, not losing the opportunity
which the enemy by their want of vigilance allowed
him. Enough of the trestles were collected from the
river to form, with two of the pontoons, two landing-places,
and two floating bridges were made of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Passage of the Guadiana.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Spanish boats. This was completed by the
afternoon of the 5th. The army immediately
began to cross; and continued crossing, without
an hour’s intermission, from three that afternoon till
after midnight on the 8th. Only one man and horse
were lost in the operation. Some country boats meantime
carried across the three days’ reserve of biscuit;
and the same proportion of slaughter-cattle swam over.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
The troops bivouacked in succession as they passed,
forming a position in a small semicircle, from Villa Real
on the right to the Guadiana on the left. Severely as the
French had suffered in the affair before Campo Mayor,
they acted at this time with as much disregard of
their enemies, as if they had no abler general than
Mendizabal to contend with, and no better troops than
those which they had so easily routed. They had
12,000 men within three hours’ march, who might have
effectually disputed the passage, or cut off the advanced
guard. But so ill were they informed of Beresford’s
movements, and so negligent in ascertaining them, that
they made no endeavour to interrupt him till the morning
of the 8th, when they advanced in some force, and
surprised before daybreak a piquet of the 13th dragoons;
but they were driven back by the 37th, which
closed the right of the position; and finding the allies
too strong for them, desisted from any further attempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Olivença retaken.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the morning of the 9th, as soon as the fog cleared,
the army marched in three columns upon Olivença:
it was thought not unlikely that the
enemy would wait for them there, or on the opposite
bank of the Valverde river, where the ground was
favourable: they had, however, fallen back to Albuhera,
leaving a garrison in Olivença. The place was summoned,
and refused to surrender; guns and stores,
therefore, were ordered from Elvas; the fourth division
remained to besiege it; and the rest of the army moved
by Valverde, and bivouacked in the wood of Albuhera,
the enemy’s rear-guard retiring before their advance,
which entered S. Martha on the 12th. Here the army
halted till the 15th, to get up provisions which were still
brought from the rear; and on that day Olivença surrendered
at discretion, before the breach was practicable.
The garrison consisted of about 480 men, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
place where Mendizabal had thrown away 3000. The
French had committed a fault of the same kind, though
not to an equal extent; the force they left there being
totally inadequate to the defence of so large a fortress.
The recapture of this place would have produced an
angry contention between the Spanish and Portugueze
Governments, if Portugal had not been rendered, by
English influence, patient in this instance under a
galling sense of injustice. The territory on the left of
the Guadiana, in which Olivença stands, was part of the
dowry given with his daughter to Affonso III. by the
Castillian king, Alfonso the Wise; a grant which,
though deemed at the time to have been an arbitrary,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Claim of the Portugueze to that place.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and therefore an illegal cession of national
rights, was subsequently confirmed to Portugal
with due form by the treaty between kings
Dinez and Ferdinand IV. But as the Guadiana might
seem to form a natural boundary between the two
kingdoms on this part of the frontier, Spain has ever
looked with an evil eye upon this cession. Five centuries
had not reconciled a people peculiarly tenacious
of what they deem national rights, to this dismemberment,
as they considered it, though in itself of little importance
to Spain, and though what had been ceded to
Portugal was in reality the right of winning it from the
Moors, and keeping it when won. In times of international
war, therefore, the possession of Olivença had
been contested not less as a point of honour than for
its own value, when it was a place of great strength;
and so strong was the border spirit which prevailed
there that, when the Spaniards captured it in 1658,
the whole of the inhabitants chose rather to leave the
town, and lose whatever they could not carry with
them, than become subjects to the King of Spain,
though the property of those who should remove was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
offered to any who would remain. It was restored at
the end of that war, and Portugal continued to hold it
till its cession was extorted in 1801, in the treaty of
Badajoz. But the war which was terminated by that
treaty had been entirely unprovoked by Portugal:
Spain was then acting as the deceived and degraded
instrument of French policy; and the Portugueze felt,
as they well might do, that the surrender, though made
to Spain, had been compelled by France; and that so
long as Spain retained Olivença by virtue of that treaty,
they were an injured people. The Prince of Brazil, in
the proclamation which he issued on his arrival in
Brazil, declaring war against France, and against Spain
as then the ally and instrument of French oppression,
had protested against the injustice which was done him
in that treaty, and declared his intention of recovering
when he could whatever he had then been compelled to
abandon: and the Spaniards were themselves so conscious
of this injustice, that the local authorities, with
the sanction of the Junta of Extremadura, had, at the
commencement of the war against Buonaparte and the
Intruder, proposed to restore Olivença and its district to
Portugal for a certain sum of money. The Central
Government had not authorised this proposal; and
Olivença was not to be thought of in times when the
independence of both nations was at stake. But fortune
had now put it in the power of the Portugueze to right
themselves: Olivença had been taken by the French,
and retaken from them by an allied force of Portugueze
and British: and one of the Portugueze Regents proposed
to his colleague the British ambassador that
the Portugueze standards should be displayed there,
without previous explanation, or subsequent justification
of the measure. There prevailed at that time a strong
feeling of irritation in the Portugueze Government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
against the Spaniards, occasioned by the conduct of the
Spanish officers on the frontier, and the unrestrained
irregularities of the Spanish troops wherever they
passed: they had even sacked a townlet near Badajoz;
an act for which the Portugueze meditated reprisals,
and had actually proposed so insane a measure to the
British ministry, when the Spanish regency allayed
their resentment by disavowing the act, and issuing
orders for the punishment of the parties concerned.
Having thus been in some degree mollified, they were
persuaded not to injure the common cause by asserting
their own claim, just and reasonable as that claim was,
but to wait the effect of a treaty then pendant with
Spain, in which the restoration of Olivença was stipulated
and not disputed. It is discreditable to Spain
that the restitution which Portugal was then contented
to wait for has not yet been made.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French retire from Extremadura.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Olivença having been taken, the allied army marched
upon Zafra and Los Santos; this movement
being designed to secure themselves from interruption
in the intended siege, and to protect
Ballasteros, who, after failing to effect a junction
with Zayas, was pressed by a French division under
General Maransin, and compelled to retire successively
on the 13th and 14th from Fregenal and Xeres de los
Cavalleros. The French, upon discovering Beresford’s
advance, on the following day retired hastily toward
Llerena, which Latour Maubourg, who had succeeded to
Mortier in the command, occupied with about 6000
horse and foot: the division which now joined him consisted
of 4000 infantry and 500 cavalry. At Los Santos
the allied cavalry fell in with the 2nd and 10th of the
enemy’s hussars, about 600 in number, who were apparently
sent on reconnoissance: they charged our 13th
dragoons weakly, and were repulsed; then retreated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
from the force which was moving against them; and
presently quickening that retreat, fled to Villa Garcia,
and were followed for nearly ten miles at a gallop. In
this they lost a chef d’escadron, killed, and about 160
men and horses prisoners: the British eleven horses of
the 4th dragoons, who died of fatigue after the chase.
The enemy remained one day longer at Llerena, and on
the following, when a movement against them had been
ordered for the next morning, retired to Guadalcanal;
thus for the time abandoning Extremadura. Beresford
then cantoned his infantry at Valverde, Azenchal, Villa
Alva, and Almendralejo, the cavalry remaining at Zafra,
Los Santos, Usagre, and Bienvenida: here the resources
of the country were sufficient for their plentiful supply.
A Spanish corps of about 1500 men, under the Conde
de Penne Villamur, belonging to Castaños’s army, occupied
Llerena. Ballasteros, with about an equal force,
was at Monasterio; and Blake, who had sailed from
Cadiz for the Guadiana on the 15th, with 6000 foot and
400 horse, had reached Ayamonte, with 5000 of his men
and 200 of his cavalry; the others had been compelled
by weather to put back. Soult was at this time uniting
his disposable force near Seville: nearly the whole corps
from the Condado de Niebla had joined him there, and
he had also drawn a detachment from Sebastiani’s corps,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 20.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and some regiments from Puerto S. Maria. This was
the situation of the respective armies when Lord
Wellington arrived at Elvas, and was met there
by Marshal Beresford.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Siege of Badajoz undertaken.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus far in this memorable campaign the war had
been conducted by the British commander as
a game of skill: it was now to become a game
of hazard. The base surrender of Badajoz distracted
his attention as much as it had disappointed his
reasonable hopes: that the place should be recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
was of the greatest importance to his future operations:
to the enemy, it was of equal importance to maintain it.
Soult could bring into the field a force sufficient for its
relief. It was well garrisoned: whatever injury had
been done to the works was thoroughly repaired: it had
sufficient artillery, and was well supplied. Lord Wellington
and Beresford reconnoitred it: three battalions

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 22.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

came out to skirmish with the reconnoitring
party, and were driven back, but with the loss
on our side of three officers and about forty men killed
and wounded. The siege, to be successful, must be
vigorously pursued, so that there might not be time
enough allowed for relieving the place: no plan, therefore,
could be adopted which would require more than
sixteen days’ open trenches: but at least twenty-two,
and this too, if the means were fully equal to the undertaking,
would be required, if either of the south fronts
were attacked, which yet it was plainly seen would have
been the preferable points of attack, had time permitted;
and means as well as time were wanting. The plan
which was adopted therefore as the only one in these
circumstances feasible, was to breach and assault Fort
Christoval, and having reduced it, to attack the castle
from thence: three or four days’ battering might, it was
thought, form a practicable breach in the castle wall,
which on that side was entirely exposed, as well as apparently
weak; and if the castle were carried, Badajoz
could make no farther resistance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bridge at Jurumenha swept away.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During the night of the 23rd the Guadiana rose
nearly eight feet and a half in the course of
twelve hours: the bridge which had been
thrown across it at Jurumenha since the army
passed was swept away, and the whole of its materials
carried down the stream and lost. The communication
was restored by another bridge of casks at the end of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
the month; but Lord Wellington, seeing the danger of
such a river in the rear of the army, immediately
changed the cantonment of the troops, and directed
Beresford to occupy and rest his rear upon Merida,
where the old Roman bridge rendered his passage at any

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Wellington recalled to Beira.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

time sure. No sooner had these instructions
been given than he was recalled to Beira by
intelligence that Massena was approaching the
Agueda in force, and seemed to threaten an attempt for
the relief of Almeida.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Inactivity of the Spanish commander in Galicia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was owing in great measure to the inactivity of the
Spanish commander in Galicia that Massena
felt himself in safety as soon as he was out of
Portugal, was enabled to rest the remains of
his army, and to draw reinforcements from Castille,
which enabled him to resume offensive operations
only fifteen days after the last of his troops had crossed
the frontier in their retreat. The enemy had received
great annoyance in Old Castille and Leon from D. Julian
Sanchez, and other guerrilla parties, but none from the
nominal army of Galicia, whose general, D. Nicolas
Mahy, had suffered Massena’s dépôts to be protected by
from 5000 to 6000 men dispersed between Burgos and
Ciudad Rodrigo. The Galicians cried out against him,
complaining that, when he had filled the prisons with
his own countrymen, he seemed to think any other
operations unnecessary. He was displaced in consequence
of their representations, and General Abadia
appointed, (after Albuquerque’s death,) to succeed him;
but Abadia had lingered at Lisbon instead of hastening
to take the command. Massena, as soon as the pursuit
ceased upon the frontier, had no danger to apprehend
from any other quarter, and his army was re-equipped
and reinforced in no longer time than would have been
necessary to recruit it after its fatigues. The Intruder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
having gone to Paris, the force which would otherwise
have been required for his personal security was disposable
for this service, so that with the cavalry and
artillery of the imperial guard, and the troops which
were collected from Castille and Leon, he mustered not
less than 40,000 effective infantry and 5000 horse.
Lord Wellington had not supposed it possible that, after
such a retreat, Massena could in so short a time have
been at the head of such a force. He arrived at Villa
Fermosa on the 28th, and at once perceived that a formidable
attempt would be made for relieving Almeida:
his own force consisted of 34,000 men, 2000 horse, including
those who were engaged in the blockade.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Country between the Agueda and Coa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The country between the Agueda and the Coa is a
high open tract, which falls in a gradual slope
from the mountains on the south in which those
rivers have their sources, to the Douro: here
and there are woods of cork and ilex, and the whole
tract is intersected and divided into ridges by streams
which run parallel to the larger rivers during the greater
part of their course, and fall most of them into the
Agueda. An army advancing into Portugal might, by
moving upon the ridge of Fuentes Guinaldo, turn the
right of all the positions that can be taken upon these
smaller streams; or if it advanced in a direct line, the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

parallel ridges and woods covering any movement
without interrupting it, would favour it in
manœuvring and directing its principal strength against
either flank. The allies were cantoned along the Duas
Casas, and toward the sources of the Azava, the light
division being at Gallegos and Espeja, upon the latter.
But the ridge between the Duas Casas and the Turon
offered the most advantageous position, because on the
left it was of difficult access in front, and on the right it
connected with the high country about Navedeaver,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
from whence the communications were easy in the direction
of Alfayates and Sabugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Massena’s address to his army.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Before Massena took the field, he addressed his troops
in another bootless boast. “Soldiers of the
army of Portugal,” said he in his general
orders, “after six months of glorious and tranquil
operations, you have returned to the first scene of
your triumphs; but the enemies of Napoleon the Great
have the audacity to blockade a fortress which they
dared not previously attempt to defend. Soldiers, if
your valour then intimidated their columns, will it not
now punish them for their temerity? Will not you
bring to their recollection that you are still the same
brave men who drove them to their trenches at Lisbon?
Some regiments of cavalry, and reinforcements from his
majesty’s guards, conducted by the marshal of the district,
assist in your efforts and your duties. Forget not
that it is your courage which must maintain that superiority
of heroism and intrepidity which forms the subject
of the admiration and the envy of other nations.
Through you, the honour of the French armies will
render renowned the hitherto unknown banks of the
Coa, as you have made the rivers of Italy and of the
North for ever memorable. Soldiers, a victory is necessary,
in order to procure you that repose which the
equipment and administration of the regiments require.
You will obtain it; and you will prepare yourselves in
the leisure that will result from it of marching to new
triumphs.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of Fuentes d’Onoro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At daybreak on the 2nd of May the main body of the
French crossed the Agueda at Ciudad Rodrigo,
and moved in two columns toward the Azava,
which they crossed that evening: our light
division fell back from its cantonments on that river,
the enemy being very superior in cavalry, and the horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
of the allies in bad condition, by reason of hard service
and wretched fodder: so great, indeed, was the want of
food for them, that it had been necessary to cut the
green rye, to the harvest of which the unfortunate
peasants had looked for their next year’s subsistence.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

On the following morning the French
continued to advance, two columns moving towards
Alameda and Fort Conception, and one, with the whole
of the cavalry, upon Fuentes d’Onoro, a little village
upon the Duas Casas. Lord Wellington had assembled
his first, third, and seventh divisions on the heights, between
that river and the Turon, in front of Villa Fermosa:
the 3rd was posted on a ridge crossing the road
from that townlet to Fuentes d’Onoro, which village was
occupied by its light companies, and by three companies
of the 5th battalion of the 60th under Lieutenant-Colonel
Williams: the first division was formed on the
right of the third, and the seventh moved from Navedeaver
towards the first, throwing our flanking parties
toward Poço Velho. This division incurred some danger
in the movement: they were in the wood of Poço Velho,
and the enemy’s cavalry got in their rear; but though
they had ground to pass on which cavalry could act,
they made good their retreat, notwithstanding the superiority
of the French in that arm. Major-General
Campbell, with the sixth, observed the bridge over the
Duas Casas at Alameda, and Sir W. Erskine the passages
of the same stream at Fort Conception and Aldea
do Bispo. Brigadier-General Pack, with his brigade of
Portugueze and the Queen’s regiment from the sixth
division, kept up the blockade of Almeida; and Julian
Sanchez occupied Navedeaver with his little party of
horse and foot, ... men more experienced in desultory
warfare than in regular battles, but of approved courage.
The extent of this position was not less than six miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
from flank to flank, the left being supported by the ruins
of Fort Conception, the right at Navedeaver: the village
of Fuentes d’Onoro was in the right of the centre,
close to the Duas Casas, situated on a slope, and concealed
by the ground: a great part of the line from that
village to the ruined fort was in a certain degree secured
by the rocky and intricate channel of the Duas Casas,
and its steep and rugged bank on the side of the allies, ...
the passage being very difficult for cavalry and artillery,
and defensible by a comparatively small force: on the
other side the position was not so strong, being nearly on
a flat, save that there was a small eminence with a tower
on its summit, on which the right rested. Head-quarters
were at Villa Fermosa, behind the Turon, about two
miles from Fuentes d’Onoro. The heights which the
troops occupied are of a very gradual ascent, accessible
to cavalry in every part, except here and there, where
there are masses of rock. The ground upon which the
French formed was a plain, with woods behind it; and
immediately in the neighbourhood of Fuentes d’Onoro
there were groves of ilex on the right bank of the Duas
Casas, which they occupied in force throughout.</p>

<p>The position which Lord Wellington had taken appeared
to Massena a fine line of battle, but he thought
it was not without danger to the troops that held it; for
they had the wild Coa behind them, and only a single
carriage communication, in itself sufficiently difficult, by
the little town of Castello Bom. This communication it
was his intention to seize; and for that purpose, while
with a part of his army he kept the centre of the allies
in check, he proceeded in force against their right, and
endeavoured to obtain possession of Fuentes d’Onoro.
Having brought up his artillery, he commenced the
attack at two in the afternoon, by a cannonade upon the
village, under cover of which fire a strong column of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
infantry moved against it. Lord Wellington perceived
his intention, and reinforced the village as occasion required
with the 71st, the 79th, and the second battalion
of the 24th. Lieutenant-Colonel Williams was wounded,
and the command then devolved on Lieutenant-Colonel
Cameron of the 79th. Repeated and vigorous efforts
were made against this post; and the enemy at one
time obtained possession of it in part, but they were
driven out before night put a stop to the action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French did not renew the attack on the following
day, but confined themselves to reconnoitring
the British position, particularly the right, toward
which they moved part of their troops, chiefly
cavalry, in the direction of Navedeaver, Massena thinking
that he had found accessible ground between that
village and Poço Velho. Lord Wellington, from the
course of his reconnoissance, inferred what was his purpose,
and in the evening moved the 7th division, under
Major-General Houston, to protect, if possible, the
passage of the Duas Casas at Poço Velho, where the
enemy intended to cross in hopes of gaining possession
of Fuentes d’Onoro from that side, and of the ground

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

behind the village. As soon as it was daylight on the
5th, this intention on their part became evident.
The allied cavalry was then moved to the left
of the 7th division, somewhat more forward; the light
division was in march from Alameda towards the same
station; the 3rd had bivouacked in a line parallel to the
ridge of the hill toward Fuentes d’Onoro; and the 1st
upon its right: these divisions were connected with each
other, and the village was occupied by part of the troops
of both, both being ready to support it. There was a
distance of about one mile from the right of the 1st
division to the ground on which the light division had
arrived, and about half a mile from thence to the 7th.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
The cavalry covered this last interval; the former was
protected by piquets and light infantry in the wood between
Fuentes d’Onoro and Poço Velho. This would
have been a critical situation for a commander less reasonably
confident in himself and in his troops. There
was no appui for the right of the British army, and it
had the Coa in its rear with only one passage for artillery.
The French were superior in numbers, and what
was of far greater importance here, greatly so in cavalry:
their horses were fresh, whereas ours had been of necessity
overworked and insufficiently fed: moreover, the
ground favoured their preparations for attack, a large
extent of wood, within little more than a mile of the
British line concealing their movements.</p>

<p>Early in the morning one of the enemy’s corps appeared
in two columns in the valley of the Duas Casas,
opposite Poço Velho, having the whole of their cavalry
under General Montbrun on the left. The infantry
directed itself against the village; the cavalry moved
through the open country between it and Navedeaver, a
part circling about, under favour of the ground, to turn
the right flank of the allies. Julian Sanchez was compelled
to retire; and so, with some loss, were two battalions
of the 7th division from Poço Velho. Houston
moved with that division to protect their retreat and that
of the cavalry, with which view he placed himself on a
rocky height, and there formed the Chasseurs Britanniques.
The first attack of their advanced cavalry was
met by a few squadrons of British, who obtained a
partial advantage, and took a colonel and some other
prisoners; but their eagerness, and still more their
inferiority, occasioned some confusion: they were in
their turn pressed, and the enemy for a short time had
possession of two guns belonging to our horse artillery.
The main body of the French cavalry advanced rapidly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
charged through the piquets of the 85th, and followed our
horse up the hill: but the attack thus gallantly begun
was not maintained with equal gallantry. The ground
was intersected with stone walls, which protected
part of our troops; those who had not that advantage
stood firm. The chasseurs under Lieutenant-Colonel
Eustace, and a detachment of the Brunswick corps, were
somewhat concealed by a rising ground, where in many
parts the rocks stood several feet above the surface:
availing themselves of this, they waited till the main
body of the enemy’s cavalry came in a line with their
front, within threescore paces, and then rising up threw
in a well-directed volley, which checked them and made
them retire in disorder; yet the charge had appeared
so formidable, that, it is said, Lord Wellington feared
the Brunswickers were lost. Their loss was trifling;
but they narrowly escaped afterward from the Portugueze,
who, because of their caps, mistook them for
enemies. The attack was renewed, but in vain, though
some of the French dismounted and acted as light infantry
to assist in it.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington had occupied Poço Velho and the
adjoining ground for the sake of maintaining his communication
across the Coa by Sabugal, while he provided
at the same time for maintaining the blockade of Almeida.
The danger of attempting both was now evident,
and looking with just confidence rather to victory than
to any likelihood of retreating, he drew in the right of
the army. Placing, therefore, the light division in reserve
in the rear of the left of the 1st, he ordered the 7th
to cross the Turon and take post on some commanding
ground, which protected the right flank and rear of the
1st, covered the communication with the Coa on that
side, and prevented that of the enemy with Almeida by
the roads between the Coa and the Turon. The 7th<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
division thus covered the rear of the right, which was
formed by the 1st in two lines. Colonel Ashworth’s
brigade, in two lines, was in the centre, and the 3rd
division, in two lines also, on the left. D. Julian’s infantry
joined the 7th in Fresneda; his horse were sent
to interrupt the communication with Ciudad Rodrigo.
Fuentes d’Onoro was in front of the left. The right of
the French infantry was opposite that village, the left
and centre between it and Poço Velho, in the wood, and
within 2000 yards of the British position. A part of
their cavalry was on the right flank of their right; a few
squadrons were with artillery opposite the 1st division,
and the main body was in the open country, from whence
the right wing of the allies had withdrawn.</p>

<p>The great object of the enemy now was to gain possession
of Fuentes d’Onoro, which was defended by the
24th, 71st, and 78th; and these regiments were supported
by the light infantry battalions of the 1st and 3rd
divisions, and some Portugueze corps. They directed
against this post several columns of their infantry supported
by artillery; succeeded in turning it by the wood
toward Poço Velho; gained possession by superior numbers
of the point of land where the chain of piquets
passed, and from thence penetrated into the village.
They even advanced some little way on the road toward
Villa Fermosa: but here the 21st Portugueze regiment
checked them; the 74th and 78th were detached by
General Picton, charged them, and retook the village.
Lieutenant-Colonel Cameron was mortally wounded, by
an enemy who stepped out of the ranks to aim at him.
His countrymen, the Highlanders at whose head he fell,
set up a shriek, and attacked the French with a spirit not
to be resisted: the man who had slain their commander
was pierced by many bayonets at once: the leader of
the French, a person remarkable for his stature and fine<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
form was killed, and the Highlanders in their vengeance
drove the enemy before them. More than once Fuentes
d’Onoro was won and lost; the contest in the streets
was so severe that several of the openings were blocked
up with the dead and the wounded, but they were finally
driven through it by Colonel Mackinnon: they kept up
a fire upon it till night closed, at which time 400 of their
dead were lying there. The command of the village
devolved upon Lieutenant-Colonel Cadogan.</p>

<p>Meantime, the enemy from the wood in front of the
British line brought fifteen pieces of cannon to bear upon
it, and with those above the village established a severe
cross fire, under cover of which, a column of infantry
attempted to penetrate down the ravine of the Turon, to
the right of the 1st division: but they were repulsed by
the light infantry of the guards, and some companies of
the 95th. Their cavalry also charged and cut through
the piquets of the guards, but were checked by the fire
of the 42nd. During the night and the succeeding day,
Lord Wellington strengthened his position by throwing
up breast-works and batteries; and this, after the lesson
he had received, deterred Massena from attempting any
farther attack. He made no movement till the 8th, nor
did Lord Wellington provoke an action: he had succeeded
in keeping his ground, and thereby maintaining
the blockade; and nothing was to be gained by attempting
more with inferior numbers, and a weak and exhausted

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French retire.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

cavalry. On the 8th and 9th, the
French collected their whole army in the woods
between the Duas Casas and the Azava, recrossed the
latter river on the evening of the 9th, and retired the
next day across the Agueda, having failed entirely in
the object for which the movement had been undertaken,
and the battle fought. The loss of the allies on both
days amounted to 1378 killed and wounded, 317 prisoners.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
That of the French was not ascertained: they
acknowledged only 400: but that number was counted in
the village of Fuentes d’Onoro, and 500 of their horses
were left dead on the field. Under the government of
Buonaparte, truth was never to be found in any public
statement, unless it was favourable to himself; and none
of his generals exercised to a greater extent than M.
Massena the license which all took of representing their
defeats as victories. This action had severely mortified
that general; he had been beaten by an army numerically
inferior to his own, and weak in cavalry, upon
ground which was favourable for that arm, and which
Lord Wellington would not have chosen, had circumstances
permitted a choice; it was an action in which
the skill and promptitude of the British commander,
and the gallantry and steadiness of the allied troops, had
been evinced throughout.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Escape of the garrison from Almeida.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Defeated in the field, and disappointed in his intention
of saving Almeida, Massena sent orders to
the Governor, General Brenier, to blow up the
works, and retire with the garrison upon Barba
de Puerco. Brenier having previously received instructions
from Bessieres and from Berthier to prepare for
thus evacuating the place, should it be necessary, had
made 140 cavities ready to be charged before the end
of April; but knowing that Massena would make
every effort to retain possession of this fortress, which
was the only fruit of his six months’ campaign in Portugal,
he had prepared also for a vigorous defence,
hoping to hold out till the first of June. The battle of
Fuentes d’Onoro put an end to his hopes; for the firing
was heard in Almeida, and proved that it was a serious
action; and as the communication which he every moment
expected did not arrive, Brenier could be in no
doubt concerning the event. Massena’s orders reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
him on the 7th. Immediately the cavities were filled,
the balls and cartridges thrown into the ditch, and
the artillery destroyed by discharging cannon into the
mouths of the pieces. Two days were thus employed; on
the morning of the 10th he assembled the officers, and
having read to them his instructions, told them, that
when the place was once demolished, the intentions of
their sovereign would be perfectly fulfilled; that that
single object ought to animate them; that they were
Frenchmen and must now prove to the universe that
they were worthy of being so. They continued to work
in destroying stores and artillery, and completing the
mines till the moment of their departure; and at ten at
night, all being assembled with the greatest silence, Brenier
gave as a watchword, Buonaparte and Bayard, and
set off (in his own words) under the auspices of glory
and honour. In coupling these names, he seems not to
have felt how cutting a reproach they conveyed to every
honourable Frenchman.</p>

<p>About one, the mines exploded; at the same time
the garrison attacked the piquets which observed the
place, and forced their way through them. They
marched in two columns, fired as little as possible, and
passed between the bodies of troops which had been
posted to support the piquets. Brenier had studied
the ground so well that he would not take a guide; a
guide, he thought, would only make him hesitate and
perhaps confuse him; the moon served as his compass,
the different brooks and rivers which he crossed were
so many points which insured his direction, and he
placed his baggage at the tail of each column, in order
that it might serve as a lure to the enemy, for to save
it he knew was impossible. On the part of the blockading
troops there was a culpable negligence; for as
the garrison had frequently attacked the nearest piquets,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
and fired cannon in the night during the whole blockade,
but more particularly while Massena was between the
Duas Casas and the Azava, they thought this attack was
nothing more than one of the ordinary sallies, and did not
even move at the sound of the explosion, till its cause
was ascertained. General Pack, however, who was at
Malpartida, joined the piquets upon the first alarm with
his wonted alacrity, and continued to follow and fire
upon the enemy, as a guide for the march of the other
troops. The 4th regiment, which was ordered to occupy
Barba del Puerco, missed the way, and to this Brenier
was chiefly indebted for his escape. Regnier was at
the bridge of San Felices to receive him, and there he
effected his junction, having lost, in this hazardous and
well-executed escape, by the French official account,
only sixty men. But the loss had been tenfold of what
was there stated. For though the lure of the baggage
was not thrown out in vain, and too many of his pursuers
stopped or turned aside to secure their booty when
the horses and mules were cast loose, he was followed
and fired upon by General Pack’s party, and by a part of
the 36th regiment, the whole way to the Agueda, 490 of
his men were brought in prisoners, and the number of
killed and wounded could not have been inconsiderable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marmont succeeds Massena in the command.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The English and their general did full justice to the
ability with which Brenier performed his difficult
attempt. Massena made use of it to colour
over his defeat, and represented the evacuation
and not the relief of Almeida as the object for
which the battle of Fuentes d’Onoro was fought.
“The operation,” he said, “which had put the army in
motion was thus terminated.” Shortly afterwards he
returned to France, with Ney, Junot, and Loison, leaving
behind them names, ever to be execrated in Portugal,
and to be held in everlasting infamy. Marmont<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
succeeded him in the command. The army, which still
called itself the army of Portugal, went into its cantonments
upon the Tormes, having, in Massena’s curious
language, <em>advanced</em> into Spain that it might rest; and
Lord Wellington set out for the south summoned by
intelligence from Marshal Beresford that Soult, notwithstanding
previous rumours, which described him as
fortifying Seville, and preparing to stand on the defensive
in Andalusia, was advancing into Extremadura.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Wellington recalled to Alentejo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

These tidings reached him on the
night of the 15th; and he set out on the following
morning.</p>

<p>When the British commander had been recalled from
Badajoz to secure the recovery of Almeida, Beresford
was left waiting till the Guadiana should fall sufficiently
for him to re-establish the bridge. The French under
Latour Maubourg, when they had been forced to retire
from Llerena, fell back to Guadalcañal; it was of importance
to push them as far off as possible during the
intended siege; and a combined movement of Colonel
Colborne, Ballasteros, and the Conde de Penne Villamur,
who commanded the cavalry of the Spanish army
in Extremadura, made them, though far superior in
force, retire to Constantino. This service having been
performed, the investment of Badajoz was commenced
on the 4th of May. But the enterprise was undertaken

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Badajoz besieged.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

under every possible disadvantage. For Marshal
Beresford had not force enough to carry
on the siege, and at the same time hold a position which
should cover it from interruption. He was as inadequately
supplied with other means as with men: ample
stores, indeed, had been ordered from Lisbon to Elvas,
and on the part of the governor at Elvas, General Leite,
nothing was wanting which his zeal and activity could
effect: but these could do little in an exhausted country,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
where carriage was not to be procured, and all that
could be brought up was miserably insufficient. At
that time also, the French were perfectly skilled both in
the attack and defence of fortified places, while we had
every thing to learn: there was not even a corps of
sappers and miners attached to the army, so that all
those preliminary operations to which men may be
trained at home, at leisure, and in perfect safety, were
here to be learnt under the fire of an enemy as well
skilled in all the arts of defence as we were deficient in
those of attack. In this branch of war they were as
superior to us as our troops were uniformly found to
theirs in the field; and it is a superiority against which
courage, though carried to the highest point, can be of
no avail. On the part of the besieged, courage and the
high sense of duty may suffice, though outworks have
fallen, walls are weak, and science wanting; this had
been proved at Zaragoza and Gerona. But it is one
thing to assail ramparts, and another to defend them;
and the braver the assailants, the greater must be their
loss, if they are not directed by the necessary skill.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Interruption of the siege.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 8th the investment of the town on the northern
side was effected, and that same evening
the siege commenced. The soil was hard and
rocky; the men unaccustomed to such work
and not numerous enough for it, for which causes, and
the want also of intrenching tools, a sufficient extent of
ground could not be opened the first night. The enemy,
who allowed no opportunity to escape them, took advantage
of this, made a sortie on the morning of the 10th,
gained possession of a battery, and when driven back
were pursued with such rash ardour to the very walls of
Fort Christoval and the <i>tête-de-pont</i> that the besiegers
lost more than 400 men. A breaching battery, armed
with three guns and two howitzers, was completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
during the next night, and on the morrow the garrison’s
well-directed fire disabled one of the howitzers and all
the guns. That same day intelligence was received
from the Regent, General Blake, that Soult had left
Seville with the declared intention of relieving Badajoz,
and that Latour Maubourg, returning upon Guadalcañal
and Llerena, had forced Penne Villamur to fall back.
Orders therefore were given to hold every man in readiness
to retire. But other accounts, on the 12th, seemed
to make it probable that Soult’s movements were only
intended against Blake, who had come to Fregenal, and
against Ballasteros, who from Monasterio had pushed
his advances toward Seville; and on that probability
Beresford ordered ground to be broken against the
castle. Fresh dispatches in the middle of the night
from various quarters, made it beyond all doubt that
Soult was rapidly advancing; immediate orders, therefore,
were given to raise the siege, for Beresford deemed
it better to meet the French marshal, and give him
battle with all the force that could be collected, Spanish,
Portugueze, and British, than by looking at two objects
to risk the loss of one. General Cole’s division was left
with some 2000 Spaniards to cover the removal of the
guns and stores; and Beresford met Blake and Castaños
at Valverde on the 14th. Any jealousy which might
have arisen concerning the command had been obviated
by a previous arrangement between Castaños and Lord

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrangement between Lord Wellington and Castaños concerning the command.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Wellington. The latter in a written memorial
concerning the operations which ought to be
pursued in Extremadura, had proposed that
whenever different corps of the allied armies
should be united to give battle, the general who
was possessed of the highest military rank, and of the
longest standing, should take the command of the whole.
This would have given it to Castaños; but he, with that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
wise and disinterested spirit which always distinguished
him, proposed, as a more equitable arrangement, that the
general who had the greatest force under his orders
should have the chief command, and that the others
should be considered as auxiliaries. Lord Wellington
perfectly approved of the alteration. “It was my duty,”
said he, “in a point so delicate as that of the allied
troops acting in concert, to submit a proposition so
reasonable in itself as to obtain universal assent; but
it was becoming the manly understanding, candour, and
knowledge of existing circumstances which characterise
your excellency to make an alteration in it, substituting
another proposal better calculated to please those of the
allies who have most to lose in the battle, for which we
must prepare ourselves.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reasons for giving battle to the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lord Wellington had left it at Beresford’s discretion
to fight a battle or retire, if circumstances
should render one or other alternative necessary.
But the effect of a retreat would, as he saw,
have been most disastrous: it would have deprived the
Spaniards of all hope for any efficient exertion on the
part of Great Britain; it would have exposed Blake and
Castaños to destruction: the British army would have
suffered a second time in reputation; the Portugueze
troops would have lost their confidence in their allies
and in themselves; and in the retreat itself, ... with an
army so dispirited, through an exhausted country, and
before such troops as the French under such a commander,
... the numerical loss might have been greater
than in a well-fought though unsuccessful engagement,
and the consequences worse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The allies assemble at Albuhera.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Our cavalry, with that of Castaños, under the Conde
de Penne Villamur, falling back as the enemy
advanced, was joined at Santa Martha by
Blake’s. The British and Portugueze infantry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
except the division which was left to cover the removal
of the stores to Elvas, occupied a position in front of
Valverde; but as this, though stronger than any which
could be taken up elsewhere in those parts, would have
left Badajoz entirely open, Beresford determined to take
up such as he could get directly between that city and
the enemy. He therefore assembled his force on the
15th at the village of Albuhera, where the roads meet
which lead to Badajoz and to Jurumenha by Valverde
and Olivença. A little above the village a brook called
Ferdia falls into the Albuhera, one of the lesser tributary
streams of the Guadiana; between these rivulets,
and beyond them, is one of the open and scattered
woods of ilex, which are common in this part of the
country. There is a bridge over the Albuhera in front
of the village. The village had been so completely
destroyed by the enemy, that there was not an inhabitant
in it, nor one house with a roof standing. The
cavalry which had been forced in the morning to retire
from Santa Martha joined here, and in the afternoon the
enemy appeared. Blake’s corps making a forced march,
arrived during the night; Cole with his division, and
the Spanish brigade under D. Carlos d’España, not till
the following morning. The 15th had been a day of
heavy rain; and both these divisions, from forced
marches, and the latter also from fatigue in dismantling
the works before Badajoz, were not in the best state for
action.</p>

<p>The whole face of this country is passable everywhere
for horse and foot; Beresford formed his army in
two lines nearly parallel to the Albuhera, and on the
ridge of the gradual ascent from its banks, covering the
roads to Badajoz and Valverde; Blake’s corps was on
the right in two lines; its left on the Valverde road
joined the right of Major-General Stewart’s division, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
left of which reached the Badajoz road, and there
Major-General Hamilton’s division closed the left of the
line. Cole’s division, with one brigade of Hamilton’s,
formed the second line. The allied force consisted of
8000 British, 7000 Portugueze, and 10,000 Spaniards;
hardly two thousand of these were cavalry. Soult had
drawn troops from the armies of Victor and Sebastiani,
and left Seville with 16,000 men; Latour Maubourg
joined him with five or six thousand; but he had a very
superior cavalry, not less then 4000, and his artillery
also was superior, he having forty-two field-pieces of
which several were twelve-pounders, the allies only
thirty. He had the greater advantage of commanding
soldiers who were all in the highest possible state of
discipline, and whom, though they were of many countries,
long habit had formed into one army; whereas the
allied force consisted of three different nations; the
Portugueze indeed disciplined by British officers, but
the Spaniards in their usual state of indiscipline; and
one third of the army not understanding, or understanding
imperfectly, the language of the other two.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 16.</span><br />Battle of Albuhera.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Soult did not know that Blake had joined during the
night, and he thought to anticipate his junction
by attacking the right of the allies, thus throwing
himself upon their line of communication,
when the possession of the rising ground would decide
the battle. At eight in the morning his troops were observed
in motion; his horse crossed the Ferdia, and
formed under cover of the wood in the fork between the
two rivulets. A strong force of cavalry, with two heavy
columns of infantry, then marched out of the wood,
pointing toward the front of the allied position, as if to
attack the village and bridge of Albuhera; while, at the
same time, under protection of that superior cavalry
which in such a country gave them command of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
field, their infantry filed over the river beyond the right
of the allies. Their intention to turn the allies by that
flank, and cut them off from Valverde, was now apparent;
upon which Beresford ordered Cole’s division to
form an oblique line to the rear of the right, with his
own right thrown back, and requested Blake to form
part of his first line and all his second to that front.</p>

<p>While the French General Godinot made a false
attack upon Albuhera, Soult, with the rest of the army,
bore on the right wing of the allies. The attack began
at nine o’clock; a heavy storm of rain came on about the
same time, as favourable to the French, who had formed
their plan, and consequently arranged their movements,
as it was disadvantageous for the allies, whose measures
were to be adapted for meeting those of the enemy.
After a gallant resistance, the Spaniards were forced
from the heights, and the enemy set up a shout of triumph
which was heard from one end of the line to the
other; their exultation was not without good cause, for
the heights which they had gained raked and entirely
commanded the whole position. The Spaniards to a
man displayed the utmost courage; but their want of
discipline was felt, and the danger of throwing them
into confusion whenever change of position was necessary;
yet the station which had been entrusted to them
was precisely that upon which the fate of the whole
army depended. They rallied at the bottom of the hill,
turned upon the enemy, and withstood them, while
Lieutenant-Colonel Colbourne brought up the right
brigade of Stewart’s division, and endeavoured to retake
the ground which had been lost.</p>

<p>These troops had been hurried as soon as the intention
of the French was perceived: they arrived too late; instead
of being the defendants of the strongest ground,
they had to assail the enemy already established there,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
and the more they advanced the more their flank became
exposed. Finding that they could not shake the enemy’s
column by their fire, they proceeded to attack it with
the bayonet; but in the act of charging, they were
themselves suddenly turned and attacked in the rear by
a body of Polish lancers: these men carried long lances
with a red flag suspended at the end, which, while so
borne by the rider as to prevent his own horse from
seeing any other object, frightens those horses who are
opposed to it. Never was any charge more unexpected,
or more destructive; the rain, which thickened the whole
atmosphere, partly concealed them; and those of the
brigade who saw them approaching mistook them for
Spaniards, and therefore did not fire. A tremendous
slaughter was made upon the troops who were thus
surprised; and the loss would have been greater, if the
Poles, instead of pursuing their advantage, had not
ridden about the field to spear the wounded. The three
regiments of Colbourne’s brigade lost their colours at
this time; those of the Buffs were recovered, after signal
heroism had been displayed in their defence. Ensign
Thomas, who bore one of the flags, was surrounded, and
asked to give it up. Not but with my life! was his
answer, and his life was the instant forfeit; but the
standard thus taken was regained, and the manner in
which it had been defended will not be forgotten when
it shall be borne again to battle. English Walsh, who
carried the other colours, had the staff broken in his
hand by a cannon ball, and fell severely wounded; but,
more anxious about his precious charge than himself, he
separated the flag from the shattered staff, and secured
it in his bosom, from whence it was taken when his
wounds were dressed after the battle.</p>

<p>The 31st regiment, being the left of the brigade, was
the only one which escaped this charge, and it kept its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
ground under Major L’Estrange. The issue of the day
seemed at this time worse than doubtful, and nothing
but the most determined and devoted courage saved the
allies from a defeat, of which the consequences would
have been worse than the immediate slaughter. The
third brigade under Major-General Houghton, with the
fusileers and Portugueze brigade under Major-General
Cole, advanced to recover the heights, their officers declaring
that they would win the field or die. Houghton
and Sir William Myers fell, each leading on his brigade.
The fusileers, and the Lusitanian legion, 3000 when
they advanced, could not muster 1000 after they had
gained the rising ground, ... for they did gain it after all
this carnage; 2000 men, and sixty officers, including
every lieutenant-colonel, and field officer, were either
killed or wounded. But the enemy in their turn suffered
greater slaughter when they were forced down
into the low ground toward the river; our musketry and
shrapnells then mowed them down. The attack upon
the village was continued somewhat longer; but the
enemy were never able to make any impression there.</p>

<p>Soult made a vigorous effort to rally his men in this
part of the field: he rode forward with an eagle in his
hand, and for a moment checked their flight; but it was
only for a moment: they saw their left retreating in
confusion, and they followed the example. Only two
battalions could be collected at first, and afterwards four,
in any order: these formed behind the first rivulet at
the foot of the ridge; the rest of their force was dispersed
like a swarm of bees, and could not be brought
up till they reached the wood. Still the superiority of
the enemy in horse was such that it was impossible for
the allies to pursue their victory. Soult therefore retired
to his bivouac in the wood, and his reserve with a powerful
artillery occupied the hill, under cover of which he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
had formed his columns of attack. The rain which had
fallen heavily during the action became more severe at
evening, and continued so that night and the following
day. The rivulets, swoln now to torrents as they poured
from the heights, were reddened with blood; and exposed
to that weather the wounded lay where they had
fallen, for there was no possibility of removing them;
not a house which could have afforded shelter was near ...
not a carriage or beast of burden could be found for
transporting them to the rear. But wickedness is ever
on the alert, and many of the wounded in this condition
were stripped to the skin, by those miscreants who attend
upon the movements of an army like birds and beasts
of prey.</p>

<p>The allies made fresh dispositions immediately after
the battle, in case the enemy should re-advance: they
improved their position by moving toward the right
flank; their freshest troops were placed in the first line;
and the flags taken from the Polish lancers, some hundreds
in number, were planted in defiance upon the
crest of the position, singular trophies of a most well-deserved
victory. Kemmis’s brigade came up the next
morning, and reinforced them with 1500 men; but all
continued quiet on both sides. On the night of the
17th, Soult moved off his wounded under cover of the
wood, and prepared for his retreat, which he commenced
the ensuing day. Our cavalry followed to hang upon
his rear, and in a very gallant affair with the rear-guard
at Usagre, about 150 of their horse were killed, wounded,
or taken, without loss on our part, though they had then
3000 men in the field, and the allies not more than half
that number. Hamilton’s division was sent back to re-invest
Badajoz: that place had remained free between
the 16th and 19th, in which interval it had received no
relief, and the garrison had only time loosely to fill up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
the approaches which had been made. Lord Wellington
arrived at Elvas on the 20th; rode over the field the
next day, and expressed himself highly pleased with
Marshal Beresford, upon whom so arduous a responsibility
had rested, and with the army which had demeaned
itself so gallantly.</p>

<p>The battle of Albuhera was one of the most murderous
in modern times. The British loss consisted of nearly
900 killed, 2732 wounded, 544 missing; the Portugueze,
of whom only a small part were brought into action,
lost about 400; the Spaniards above 2000. The French
left 2000 dead on the field; about 1000 were made
prisoners; Generals Werle and Pepin were killed.
Soult, in his official dispatch, declared, that his whole
loss amounted only to 2800 men; but a letter from
General Gazan was intercepted, wherein he stated that
he had more than 4000 wounded under his charge. The
heat, he said, would prove very injurious to them, especially
as there were only five surgeons to attend them,
and many had died upon the road. This letter was written
three days after the action, and as the bad cases die
in numbers in the first few days, and the mortality must
have been greatly increased by want of rest, of accommodation,
and of surgical aid, it was inferred, that the
total loss of the enemy could not have been less than
8000 men. Soult is said to have acknowledged, that,
in the whole course of his long service, he had never
before seen so desperate and bloody a conflict. He is
said, also, to have observed, “there is no beating those
troops, in spite of their generals! I always thought
them bad soldiers, and now I am sure of it; for I turned
their right, and penetrated their centre; they were completely
beaten; the day was mine, and yet they did not
know it, and would not run.” About 300 of his prisoners
were put into a convent which had been converted into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
a prison: they undermined the wall, and escaped with
their officers at their head. The peasantry guided them,
and supplied them with food on their way, and they rejoined
the army in a body on the thirteenth day after
the battle.</p>

<p>The official dispatch of the French general was, as
usual, falsified for the public. Soult there asserted that,
having gained the height, he was surprised to see so
great a number of troops, and that he then first learned
from a prisoner how Blake with 9000 Spaniards had
effected a junction during the night. This discovery,
he said, made him resolve not to pursue his victory, but
content himself with keeping the position which had
been taken from the enemy, and that position he<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> retained,
... the enemy, after the carnage which was made
among them by Latour Maubourg and the Polish lancers,
not having dared to attack him again.</p>

<p>Few battles have ever given the contending powers
so high an opinion of each other. The French exhibited
the highest possible state of discipline that day: nothing
could be more perfect than they were in all their movements;
no general could have wished for more excellent
instruments, and no soldiers were ever directed by more
consummate skill. This was more than counterbalanced
by the incomparable bravery of their opponents. The
chief loss fell upon the Buffs and the 57th. The first
of these regiments went into action with twenty-four
officers and 750 rank and file; ... there only remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
five officers and thirty-four men to draw rations on the
following day. Within the little space where the stress
of the battle lay, not less than 7000 men were found
lying on the ground, literally reddening the rivulets with
blood. Our dead lay in ranks as they had fought, and
every wound was in front. A captain of the 57th, who
was severely wounded, directed his men to lay him on
the ground at the head of his company, and thus continued
to give his orders. Marshal Beresford saved his
life by his dexterity and personal strength: as he was
encouraging his troops after the charge of the Polish
lancers, one of these men attacked him; avoiding the
thrust, he seized him by the throat, and threw him off
his horse; the lancer recovered from his fall to aim a
second thrust, but at the moment was shot by one of the
general’s orderlies. Sir William Meyers, leading on
that brigade which recovered the fortune of the field,
exclaimed it would be a glorious day for the fusileers.
In ascending the ground his horse was wounded; another
was brought, which he had hardly mounted, when
a ball struck him under the hip, and passed upward
obliquely through the intestines. He did not fall, and
attempted to proceed; but this was impossible, and
when he was carried off the field he seemed to forget
his own sufferings in exultation at beholding the conduct
of his brave companions. A heavy rain was falling;
there was no shelter near, and Valverde, whither it was
thought proper to convey him, was ten miles distant.
He would rather have had a tent erected over him; but
his servants hoping that he might recover, insisted upon
removing him to a place where a bed might be procured.
The body of General Houghton was borne past him, on a
mule, to be interred at Elvas. Upon seeing it, Sir William
desired, that if he should die they would bury him
on the spot. He lived, however, to reach Valverde, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
till the following day. When his dissolution drew near,
he desired that his ring might be taken to his sister, and
that she might be told he had died like a soldier. Six
of his own men bore him to the grave, and laid him
under an olive tree near Valverde. It is to be hoped
that a monument will be placed there to mark the spot.</p>

<p>Blake, Castaños, Mendizabal, Ballasteros, Zayas, and
Carlos d’España, were in the field, and all distinguished
themselves. Blake and Castaños had each an arm
grazed. España was run through the hand by a lance.
In the heat of the action, when the issue of the battle
appeared most hopeless, many of the Spaniards were
heard exclaiming to each other, “What will the <i>Conciso</i>
say?” ... thus stimulating themselves to new exertion by
remembering the honour or dishonour which a free press
would bestow, according to their deserts. Of three
stand of colours which were taken from the enemy, one
was presented to the Cortes. Del Monte moved, that it
should be deposited in some church dedicated to the
Virgin-Mother, the patroness of the Spains; but Garcia
Herreros observed, that the hall in which they met
would, after the dissolution of the Cortes, again be used
as a church, and it was therefore resolved that the
colours should remain there. It was proposed also, that
a pillar should be erected in the plains of Albuhera; and
that the little town of that name which had been entirely
destroyed, should be rebuilt by the nation, and exempted
from all rates and taxes for ten years.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Siege of Badajoz resumed.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By this time the 3rd and 7th divisions arrived from
Beira. Lord Wellington re-invested Badajoz
on the 25th, and broke ground four days afterward.
It was well that the former siege had
been interrupted; there would otherwise have been a
great sacrifice of men in attempts which, for want of
adequate means, must have been unsuccessful. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
means, though somewhat increased both in men and
materials, were still inadequate; time pressed also; for
where Lord Wellington’s efforts were directed, thither
would those of the enemy be directed also; Marmont
would move from the Tormes toward the Tagus to
co-operate with Soult against him, and the disposable
force which they might bring together far exceeded all
that he could command. Rapid measures, therefore,
were necessary, and it was determined to pursue the
original plan, but to commence the attacks upon Fort
Christoval and the castle at the same time, that the
enemy’s attention might be divided. Guns were brought
from Elvas, and the officers and gunners of a company
of British artillery were distributed among the Portugueze,
to supply as far as their numbers went the
want of skill in their allies: but the guns were of a
soft composition of metal, false in their bore, without
any of the modern improvements; the shot were of
all shapes and sizes; the howitzers which were used
for mortars were not better in their kind than the guns,
nor did the shells fit them better; and these wretched
brass pieces failed so fast under the heavy firing which
was required, that iron guns were ordered from Lisbon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June.</span><br />Unsuccessful attempts upon Fort Christoval.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 6th of June the breach in Fort Christoval was
reported practicable; it appeared to be so from
the trenches; and at the following midnight
a storming party of 180 men, conducted by
Lieutenant Forster of the Royal Engineers, who
had examined the breach the preceding night, moved
towards it. The palisades had been destroyed by the
battery; the counterscarp at that spot was only four
feet deep; the advance, therefore, easily descended into
the ditch and reached the foot of the breach, where
they discovered that since evening closed the enemy
had removed the rubbish, and that the escarp was standing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
clear nearly seven feet high. The advance, after it
had in vain endeavoured to get over this obstacle, might
have retired with little loss: but the main body had
now entered the ditch; and in that spirit of mad courage
which attempts impossible things, they tried with
ladders fifteen feet long, which had been sent for mounting
the breach with, to escalade the front scarp of the
fort where it was twenty feet high; in this they persisted
for an hour, while the garrison showered down
upon them shells, stones, hand-grenades and combustibles
at pleasure, and almost as a sport; nor did they retire
till they had lost twelve killed and ninety wounded, more
than two-thirds of their number, Forster being among
the slain. Not disheartened by this, the besiegers renewed
the attempt three nights after: they were provided
with ladders of sufficient length; but the enemy
were now on the alert, and had strongly garrisoned the
fort: the officer who conducted the advance was killed
on the glacis, and the officer in command immediately
on descending into the ditch: and it could not be
ascertained, from the report of the survivors, whether
they had attempted a breach which, having, as on the
former occasion, been cleared, had been rendered impracticable,
or whether their efforts had been misdirected
against the face of a demibastion which had
been much injured, and might in the night easily be
mistaken for a breach: but in one or other of these
blind endeavours they persisted desperately under a
tremendous shower of the most destructive missiles, till
after an hour’s perseverance, when forty had been killed
and an hundred wounded, the remainder were ordered
to retire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The siege raised.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>That night’s failure determined Lord Wellington to
raise the siege. It had manifestly become hopeless
for want of means; and the next morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
an intercepted letter from Soult to Marmont was
brought in, dated the 5th, and saying that he was ready
to begin his march, effect a junction, and complete the
object of their wishes. “If they lost no time,” he said,
“they might reach the scene of action before the English
reinforcements arrived, and Badajoz would be
saved.” By other communications, Lord Wellington
knew that Drouet’s corps had marched from Toledo,
and would probably join Soult that very day, and that
Marmont might be expected at Merida in a few days;
for this general, after having patroled on the 6th to
Fuentes d’Onoro and Navedeaver, as a reconnoissance,
and to cover the march of a convoy to Ciudad Rodrigo,
began his march the next day to the south, by way of
the Puerto de Baños and Placencia: he crossed the
Tagus at Almaraz, an important point, where the
French, having re-established the bridge, had covered it
by strong batteries. In consequence of this information
Lord Wellington began to move the stores to the rear,
as soon as darkness had closed. The whole loss had
been nine officers and 109 men killed, twenty-five officers
and 342 men wounded and prisoners: but the numerical
inadequately represents the real loss in those operations
for which men are either selected for their skill, or adventure
in the hope of distinguishing themselves. On
the 12th the siege was finally raised; but the blockade
was still maintained, and Lord Wellington posted his
army near Albuhera to cover it and to hold in check an
enemy who would not again venture upon giving battle,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junction of Soult and Marmont.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

unless with an overpowering force. The French,
however, had now collected all their troops from
the two Castilles, except a small garrison at
Madrid, all the remains of Massena’s army, and all their
force from Andalusia, except what was sufficient for
Sebastiani and Victor to keep up a show of inactive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
strength within positions where experience had now
fully shown that no vigorous attack was to be apprehended.
Thus they brought together a greater force
than the allies could oppose to them; and though Lord
Wellington was not so inferior in numbers as to have
felt fear, or even doubt, concerning the issue of an action,
the relative resources of the allies in men, as
those resources were then managed, were not such
that they could afford to win a second battle of Albuhera.
The blockade therefore was raised after Marmont
and Soult had effected their junction: the enemy
entered Badajoz, and the allies, recrossing the Guadiana,
took up a line within the Portugueze frontier.
There the corps from the north, under Sir Brent Spencer,
joined them. It had crossed the Tagus at Villa Velha by
a floating bridge, carrying about twenty horses at a time.
The spirit of our light division at this time was such
that the men would suffer any thing on a march rather
than be seen straggling; and in this movement two
men, when ascending the hills to Niza, carried that
spirit so far that they actually died of heat in the ranks.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The allies take a position within the Portugueze frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The whole army being thus united, a position
was chosen in which battle would have been
given if the French had attempted to enter
Portugal: it was on the heights behind Campo
Mayor, and the troops were bivouacked on the Caya in
readiness to occupy it: their line extended from Arronches
to Jurumenha, that of the enemy from Merida
to Badajoz. But though the French had brought together
not less than 70,000 men including 8000 cavalry,
while the cavalry opposed to them were only 3500, and
the whole force not more than 56,000, they contented
themselves with making a reconnoisance in considerable
strength. One body of their horse got in the rear of a
piquet of the 11th light dragoons: the situation was ill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
chosen; the regiment had arrived from England but a
few days before; the men, therefore, were inexperienced
in such service, and ignorant of the ground: they mistook
the enemy for Portugueze; and every man, sixty-nine
in number, except the lieutenant in the advance,
was taken. This was the only advantage they could
obtain. Another body at the same time failed in an
endeavour to ascertain the position and number of the
allies: their intention was perceived; the main body of
the troops was concealed from them behind the hills;
and after some hours’ manœuvring, some skirmishing,
and some firing from Campo Mayor, the guns of which
fortress flanked the front of Lord Wellington’s position,
they desisted from their baffled attempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Soult boasts of his success.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Soult affected to regret that a general action had not
been brought on. He magnified the merit of
the defence of Badajoz, saying, that it would be
cited in military history as one of the most
memorable exploits of its kind; and he magnified the
importance of the junction of the two armies on the
Guadiana, calling it one of the most marked events of
the war in Spain. This general had a more than common
interest in blazoning forth a success which covered
his late defeat. “Thus,” said he, “the signal victory
which was gained at Albuhera has been ascertained in
favour of the imperial army: the main object which I had
in view was then accomplished, that of making a diversion
in favour of Badajoz, and enabling that fortress to
prolong its resistance. It is now evident that the battle
of Albuhera gained us at least twenty days, during
which we were enabled to make arrangements for bringing
up new reinforcements, and the army of Portugal
was able to take part in the operations: thus the second
object which I had in view in making my first movement
has been also accomplished; and the troops which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
fought at Albuhera have not ceased a single day to act
upon the offensive against the enemy.” Beyond all
doubt Marshal Soult was one of the ablest generals of
his age: his operations at this time were ultimately successful,
but his earnestness to prove that he had gained
a victory at Albuhera only shows how deeply he felt
the defeat.</p>

<p>The French government were elated with an advantage
which came seasonably after the various disgraces
that the French arms had suffered in the Peninsula.
“The English,” said they, “are again to learn, and by
a mighty thunderbolt ... (the raising of the siege of
Badajoz is a presage of it), that they cannot with impunity
leave the element of which they have usurped
the empire.” The English, however, had long been
accustomed to hear of these thunderbolts, and to defy
the more tangible weapons of the enemy. Soult said,
in his official account, “that they appeared to have
given us Spain entirely, and to be concentrating themselves
for the defence of Lisbon: they felt their inability
to support the contest; and every thing,” he added,
“induced him to think that when the army of reserve
should have arrived upon Almeida, they would feel the
impossibility even of maintaining themselves at Lisbon.”
While the enemy threw out these boastful anticipations,
Lord Wellington remained in his position, watching
their movements, and certain that they could not long
subsist the force which they had brought together.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Blake’s movements.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Before the allies retreated across the Guadiana, a
plan had been arranged between General Blake
and Lord Wellington, that the former should
make a movement into the country of Niebla, distract the
enemy’s attention by threatening their rear, and take
advantage of whatever favourable opportunity this concentration
of the French forces might give him. Accordingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
the Spaniards set out on the 18th from
Jurumenha, and on the 22nd reached Mertola, ... the
distance is about 110 miles, ... but it was a most exhausting
march in the midst of summer, through a dry
country, for troops half of whom were barefoot, and
whose commissariat was in the most deplorable state.
The provisions were never sufficient to allow full rations;
and though the Spaniards supported fatigue and
hunger with their characteristic patience, men will not
continue to undergo such privations without a strong
hope that some adequate success will recompense them;
and Blake had unhappily acquired the character of
being an unfortunate leader.</p>

<p>From Mertola, he embarked his artillery for Ayamonte.
The horse swam the Guadiana, the men crossed
it by a temporary bridge of boats; and after resting
two days to refresh the troops, he marched

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 30.</span><br />He fails at Niebla and returns to Cadiz.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

against Niebla. Niebla is an old town, which
had fallen to such decay, that its population at
this time did not exceed an hundred persons:
its walls, however, were less dilapidated than its houses,
and the French had repaired its castle so as to render it
a post of respectable strength, from whence they
domineered over the surrounding country. Blake found
it stronger than he expected: he attempted an escalade
in the night with ladders, which were too short, as well
as too few, for the success of the enterprise; consequently
the attempt failed, though the garrison did not
consist of more than 300 men. He remained three days
before the place, which gave the French governor of
Seville time to take the field against him, and make
some prisoners before his army could reach the mouth
of the Guadiana, and re-embark for Cadiz. Great numbers
of his men deserted during this ill-conducted expedition.
Blake possessed considerable talents, but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
good which those talents might have produced, when he
was called to the Regency, was in great measure frustrated
by his jealousy of the English. At Albuhera he
seemed to have overcome this unworthy feeling; but it
returned upon him, and Lord Wellington remarked, in
his public dispatches, that neither General Castaños nor
himself had received any intelligence from him since he
began his march from Jurumenha.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French armies separate.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This movement, therefore, which might have greatly
annoyed the enemy, and of which such expectations
had been raised, that it was at one time
reported and believed Blake had actually entered
Seville, ended only in the diminution of the army
and of the general’s reputation. But Lord Wellington
had taken his measures too wisely to suffer any other
evil than that of disappointed hope from this failure.
He knew that the enemy could not possibly long continue
to subsist their forces when thus concentrated; and
accordingly, as he expected, they broke up from the
Guadiana about the middle of July, having fortified the
old castles of Medellin and Truxillo to strengthen their
hold upon Extremadura. Soult returned to Seville; and
Marmont, recrossing the Tagus at Almaraz, went again
to his command in the north. Lord Wellington then
moved his whole army to the left, and cantoned them in
Lower Beira, where he remained, waiting till time and
opportunity should offer for the blow which he was
preparing to strike.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">Both</span> in Portugal and in Andalusia the French had at
length encountered a resistance which, with their utmost
efforts, they were unable to overcome: but their career
of success continued longer in the eastern provinces,
where their operations were conducted with more unity
of purpose, and where Great Britain afforded only a
precarious and inefficient aid to the best and bravest of
the Spaniards.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Plans of the French in Catalonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>No sooner had Tortosa fallen, than Marshal Macdonald
began to prepare at Lerida for laying siege to
Tarragona. The arrival at Barcelona of a convoy
of ammunition and grain from Toulon relieved
him from all anxiety on that point, and left him
at leisure to direct his whole attention to this great object,
which in a military view would complete the conquest
of Catalonia, ... any other Buonaparte was incapable
of taking. Tortosa was to be the pivot of the
intended operations against Tarragona first, and after its
fall, which was not doubted, against Valencia; and to
facilitate these operations, Col de Balaguer was put in
a state of defence, and Fort Rapita which commanded
the mouth of the Ebro. These measures had been
taken when General Suchet received orders from Paris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
to undertake the siege, and was at the same time informed
that Lower Catalonia was to be under his command.
Early in the preceding year this general had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 19.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

been told that he must raise in his government
of Aragon means both for the pay and subsistence
of his troops, France being no longer able to
support such an expense; and that while he was to
communicate as before with the <i>E’tat-major</i> of the army

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Pyrenean provinces administered in Buonaparte’s name.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

concerning military affairs, he was to receive instructions
upon all matters relating to the administration,
police, and finances of the country,
from the Emperor alone. It was evident, therefore,
that Buonaparte was as little disposed to
keep faith with his brother, King Joseph, as he had
been with his ally Charles IV., and Ferdinand his invited
guest, but that it was his intention to extend the
frontier of France from the Pyrenees to the Ebro; and
in fact from that time all orders of the government in
that part of the Peninsula were issued in his name.
The faithful Spaniards cared not in which name it was
administered, acknowledging neither, and detesting both:
if they had any feeling upon the subject, it was a sense
of satisfaction that their unworthy countrymen in the
Intruder’s service should be deprived of the shallow
pretext with which they sought to excuse their treason
to their country. At first this change appeared to increase
the difficulties of Suchet’s situation, who, while
he looked only to a temporary occupation of the province,
would without scruple have supplied himself by
force, regardless in what condition he might leave it to
those who should succeed him, or what sufferings he
might bring upon the inhabitants. But regarding himself
now as fixed in a permanent command, it behoved
him to adopt measures which, ... if any thing could have
that effect upon the Aragonese, might gradually reconcile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
them to subjection, by giving them the benefit of
a military government, regularly as well as vigorously
administered.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of Aragon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The province was in a miserable state: though the
population had increased from the end of the
Succession war till the beginning of Charles
IV.’s reign, it had diminished since that time, owing to
causes which have not been explained. There were
150 deserted villages in it, and nearly 400 in which a
few houses were all that remained, ... this, not in consequence
of the existing war, but of the preceding decay.
Yet before the invasion, Aragon exported corn, wine,
and oil to Catalonia on one side, and to Navarre on the
other: to that export the war had put an end; fields,
and vineyards, and oliveyards, had been laid waste; and
an enormous consumption of sheep by the armies had
almost destroyed the only kind of cattle which in that
country could be depended on for food. It had been
drained of money also both by the national and intrusive
governments: before the siege of Zaragoza, three millions
of francs had been remitted to Seville; and the
spoils of the suppressed convents to the amount of a million
<i>reales</i> and 3000 marks of silver had been afterwards
sent to Joseph’s treasury at Madrid. Very many families,
and among them all the wealthiest, had emigrated,
taking with them all the specie they could collect, ... the
miserable remains of their fortunes. Trade had suffered
in the same degree as agriculture; there were no
manufacturers left; and from a province in this condition,
which in its best times paid only four million francs
to its native government, eight millions were to be raised
for the annual pay of the troops alone. Suchet began by
levying an extraordinary contribution per month, which

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>System of the French general.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

more than doubled in amount the tax in ordinary
times; the mode of collecting was prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
for him by a regulation of Philip V., who, as a
punishment upon the three provinces of Aragon, Catalonia,
and Valencia, for their adherence to his opponent
the Archduke Charles, had subjected them to a property
tax, taking from them the privilege which they had formerly
possessed of taxing themselves. It might have
been thought impossible to wring this additional impost
from a ruined people; but the hoards of prudence, of
selfishness, and of misery are opened at such times, and
what has been withheld from the pressing necessities of
a just cause, is yielded to a domineering enemy; and
Suchet, while he insisted to the utmost upon the law of
the strongest, and regarded no other law, had clear
views of the policy by which obedience to that law is to
be facilitated or conciliated. No compunction withheld
him from any crime which he deemed it expedient to
commit; but he would do good as well as evil, and perhaps
more willingly, when it accorded with his purpose;
and worldly wisdom producing the effect of better motives
might under other circumstances have made him a
beneficent ruler. He abolished monopolies, by retaining
which nothing was to be gained; he sent for his wife
from France, to conciliate the Aragonese ladies by her
means, and their husbands by theirs; he employed the
influence of those priests who followed the example of
their traitorous archbishop; and he purchased with
offices in the revenue department and in the police the
ablest of the Spaniards whose souls were for sale.
Among them was Mariano Dominguez, who having held
the office of military Intendant under Palafox during the
siege of Zaragoza, lived to be praised by General Suchet
for the eminent services which he rendered to the French.
He was made corregidor of that city; and it is said that
under his administration not a single murder occurred
there during eighteen months, though before the war the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
annual average exceeded three hundred. In no situation
does a man seem so cut off from repentance, as when he
can reconcile himself to his own dereliction of duty by
the good that he may do in an office which he has accepted
as the price of his integrity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Good effect of paying the troops regularly.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The money which Suchet raised for his military and
civil establishments was presently expended in
the province, to the immediate benefit of the
people upon whom it had been levied. The
troops were paid every five days, the civil officers regularly
received their salaries, and what they received
was necessarily spent in the country. Suchet took care
also to purchase there whatever it could supply for the
clothing and equipment of the troops, paying for it at
once from the contributions; and the active circulation

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mémoires du Maréshal Suchet, 1. 302.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

which was thus occasioned, if he may be believed,
made the inhabitants themselves sensible
that they were gainers by such taxation. He
repaired the dykes, the sluices, and the great basin at
Mount Torrero which had been destroyed during the
siege; the canal was thus again restored: preparations
were made for conducting water into the city and erecting
fountains there: the hospitals and the bull circus were
repaired; bull fights, the national sport and the national
reproach, were exhibited; and by these means ... and by
his refusal to send the treasure of Our Lady of the
Pillar to Madrid, notwithstanding repeated orders to
that effect, ... he endeavoured to gratify the Zaragozans,
while he erected works about the city to secure it against
any sudden attempt. Buonaparte’s orders were not so
safely to be disregarded as those of the Intruder; when,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>British goods burnt at Zaragoza.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

therefore, Suchet was instructed to confiscate
and burn all the English goods which could be
found in Aragon, the general remonstrated
against so impolitic a measure, and proposed instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
to levy a duty upon such goods of fifty per cent.; but
Buonaparte hated England too vehemently to be capable
of receiving any advice which opposed the indulgence
of that insane passion, and Suchet found it necessary to
search the warehouses, and make a bonfire of what he
found there, in the <i>Plaza Mayor</i> at Zaragoza, taking
care however that the search should be as perfunctory
as he could venture to make it, and leaving colonial

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mémoires, 1. 306.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

produce untouched because it happened not to
be specified in his orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations for besieging Tarragona.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But the Spaniards were a people whom no length of
time could reconcile to an usurpation by which
they felt themselves insulted as much as they
were wronged and outraged. Though his political
sagacity was equal to his military skill, and though
he was placed in a part of the peninsula where the
Spaniards never received the slightest assistance from
their British allies, even in Aragon he felt the insecurity
of his position, and deemed it an advantage of no trifling
moment when he could discover a manufactory of arms
among the mountains. The Spanish frontier is that
upon which France was least provided with military
establishments; but the want of stores, which in other
quarters could be drawn abundantly from the arsenals
of Douay, Metz, and Strasbourg, was supplied here by
the treacherous seizure of Pamplona before hostilities
commenced, and by the subsequent capture of Lerida,
Mequinenza, Tortosa, and Col de Balaguer. In this
respect the war had abundantly furnished its own
means; nor was he deficient in numbers for the siege
which he was about to undertake, the army now under
his command consisting of more than 40,000 men, notwithstanding
its daily waste, and the great losses it had
suffered. The Italian division from 13,000 to 14,000 had
been reduced to five or six; but with the population of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
France, Italy, and the Netherlands, at his disposal, and
of those states which, under the name of confederates,
were actually subjected to the French government, Buonaparte
thought that no war could thin his armies faster
than the conscription could recruit them; and under
his officers he well knew that men of any nation would
soon be made efficient soldiers. Suchet found it better
to make the regiments of different nations act together
than to keep them in separate divisions; they were
more likely thus to be influenced by a common feeling,
and less liable to be affected by the proclamations in
Italian, German, Dutch, and Polish, as well as Spanish
and French, which General Doyle addressed to them,
inviting them to abandon the unjust service in which
they were engaged. Suchet provided also for their
wants with a solicitude which made him deservedly
popular among his men. He saw that the commissariat
department was better administered by military than by
civil agents; and having placed it therefore wholly in
their hands, he adopted the farther improvement of
giving to each regiment the charge of its own cattle,
convoys of which from Pau and Oleron were constantly
on the road, protected by a chain of fortified posts from
Canfranc and Jaca to Zaragoza. It was found that by
this means the cattle were better guarded and more
easily fed; that the movements of the army were not
impeded by them; and that when the soldiers reached
their bivouac they were no longer under the necessity of
marauding for their food. This general was as little
subject as Massena to any visitations of compassion;
but he knew that a system of marauding must in the
end prove as fatal to the army which subsisted by it, as
to the inhabitants who were the immediate sufferers.</p>

<p>But the people whom he protected from irregular
exactions were under an iron yoke; they were to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
kept down only by present force and the severest intimidation;
and Suchet prepared willingly for the siege of
Tarragona, because he saw that the only serious losses
which the Spaniards sustained was when they defended
fortified places with a large military force. Their
armies, when routed in the field, collected again as
easily as they were dispersed; but from Lerida, Mequinenza,
and Tortosa, no fewer than 800 officers and
18,000 soldiers had been sent prisoners into France. He
desired therefore to attack a fortress which would be
regularly defended, as much as he dreaded to encounter

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mémoires. 2. 17.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

a civil defence. While he was preparing for
the enterprise, the news of Massena’s retreat
raised the hopes of the Spaniards, and made their desultory
parties everywhere more active: in proportion as
they were elated, were the invaders exasperated. A

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Manresa burnt by Macdonald.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

considerable force under Marshal Macdonald
moved upon Manresa. Sarsfield and Eroles
were on the alert to harass its movements: and
they attacked its rear at Hostal de Calvet, about an
hour’s distance from that city: many of the Manresans
were in the field. The disposition of the inhabitants
was well known, and perhaps Manresa was marked for
vengeance, because it was the first place in Catalonia
which had declared against the French; and one of
those journals also was printed there which contributed
so greatly to keep up the national spirit. Upon whatever
pretext, ... for pretexts are never wanting to those
who hold that everything ought to succumb before

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 30.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

military force, ... orders were given to burn the
city: it was set on fire in the night, and between
seven and eight hundred houses were consumed.
The very hospitals were not spared, though an agreement
had been made between the Spanish and French
generals, that they should be considered sacred, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
though that agreement was produced by one of the
physicians to General Salme, and its observance claimed
on the score of honour and good faith as well as of
humanity. It availed nothing; the wounded were taken
out of their beds; the attendants plundered; the building
sacked and set on fire. It was by the light of the
flames that Sarsfield and Eroles attacked the enemy at
Hostal de Calvet; their orders were that no quarter
should that night be given; and in consequence, of
many who surrendered (for in this partial action the Catalans
had greatly the advantage), one man alone was
spared. The commander-in-chief Campoverde accused
Macdonald of having in this instance broken his faith,
as well as violated the received usages of war; and he

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

issued orders that his troops, regular or irregular,
should give quarter to no Frenchman, of
what rank soever, who might be taken in the vicinity
of any place which had been burned or sacked, or in
which the inhabitants had been murdered. Subscriptions
were raised for the relief of the Manresans; and,
as in every case where intimidation was intended, the
effect of this atrocity was to render the invaders more
odious, and give to that desire of vengeance with which
the Spaniards were inflamed the dreadful character of a
religious obligation.</p>

<p>Macdonald was at this time meditating an attempt
upon Montserrat, the possession of which place would
be of great advantage in the operations against Tarragona.
But the Catalans were not idle. Looking to
something of more permanent importance than could be
achieved in desultory warfare, Rovira, who from the
commencement of the struggle had so distinguished
himself as to be honoured with the particular invectives
of the French, had long projected schemes for recovering
from the enemy some of the fortresses whereof<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
they had possessed themselves, and these schemes he
proposed to the successive generals in the principality, all
of whom, till Campoverde took the command, regarded
them as impracticable. Rovira, however, was not deterred
by ridicule from prosecuting plans which appeared
to him well founded; and Campoverde at length listened

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Scheme for the recovery of Barcelona frustrated.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to his representations. He had established a
communication in Barcelona, which, like other
attempts of the like nature, was discovered; and
five persons, two of whom were women, were
condemned to death for it, but only one, Miguel Alzina
by name, fell into the enemy’s hand, and he was executed
upon the glacis of Monjuic. The sentence charged him
with having conspired to betray that fortress and the
place of Barcelona to the Spaniards: this he had done,
and in suffering for it, felt that he was dying a martyr
to his country’s cause: but he was charged also with
having intended to poison the garrison; and that any
such purpose should have been sanctioned by the commander-in-chief,
under whose sanction the scheme was
formed, or that it should have been communicated to
him, or even formed at all, is not to be believed. Of
the persons who were acquitted of any share in the
conspiracy, two were nevertheless ordered to be sent
into France, and there detained till the general pacification
of Catalonia; and one, who was niece of Alzina, to
be confined in a nunnery, under the special observation
of the vicar-general and of the prioress, who were to be
responsible for her.</p>

<p>Rovira had concerted a plan also for surprising
Figueras: it was conceived in the spirit of more adventurous
ages, and therefore, some of those persons who
felt no such spirit in themselves called it, in mockery,
the Rovirada; to better minds, however, it appeared so
feasible for men like those who had undertaken it, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
Martinez, the commandant of the division of Ampurdan,
was instructed by Campoverde to join him in the attempt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Figueras.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Figueras is a little town situated in the midst of the
fertile plain of Ampurdan, eighteen miles from
the French frontier. Some centuries ago it was
burned, and its castle razed, by the Count of Ampurias,
in his war with Jayme I. of Aragon; but in the last
century, Ferdinand VI. erected there one of the finest
fortifications in Europe, which he called, after his canonized
namesake and predecessor, the Castle of St.
Fernando. It is an irregular pentagon, the site of
which has been so well chosen upon the solid and bare
rock, that it is scarcely possible to open trenches
against it on any side; and it commands the plain, serving
as an entrenched camp for 16,000 men. As a fortress
it is a masterpiece of art; no cost was spared upon it,
and the whole was finished in that character of magnificence
which the public works of Spain continued to
exhibit in the worst ages of the Spanish monarchy.
But an English traveller made this prophetic remark

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Townsend’s Travels, 1. p. 81. 3rd edition.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

when he visited Figueras in the year 1786:
“Every such fortress requires an army to
defend it, and when the moment of trial comes,
the whole may depend on the weakness or treachery of
a commander, and instead of being a defence to the
country, may afford a lodgement to the enemy.” Nowhere
has that apprehension been more fully verified
than in the place where it was excited. Figueras was
surrendered to France in the revolutionary war, by corruption
or by treason, more likely than by cowardice; for
the governor had behaved bravely at Toulon. After the
peace he returned to Spain, was delivered over to trial,
and condemned to lose his head: but the punishment
was commuted for perpetual exile. When the place<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
was restored, after the treaty of Basle, some ink spots
still remained upon the wall, where an officer, in honourable
indignation, had dashed his pen, either determining
not to sign the capitulation, or in despair for
having borne a part in that act of infamy. And now
Figueras served as a stronghold for the invaders, having
been one of the four fortresses which Godoy delivered
into their hands as the keys of Spain, before
Buonaparte avowed his profligate design of usurping
the kingdom.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Attempt upon Figueras.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Rovira, who was a doctor in theology as well as a
colonel, and regarded the contest to which he
had devoted himself as a holy war, fixed upon
Passion week as the fittest time for the attempt:
there could be no season so proper for it, he
thought, as that on which the church was celebrating

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the sufferings and death of Christ<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>! Accordingly,
on Palm Sunday he assembled his division
in the village of Esquirol, and when they were drawn
up, addressing them, says the Spanish relator, like another
Gideon, he desired that every man who was willing
to accompany him in an expedition of great peril, but of
the highest importance and greatest honour, should step
out of the line; 500 men immediately volunteered, all of
the second Catalan legion. The same appeal was made
to another detachment at S. Privat, and ninety-two of
the battalion of Almogavares, and 462 of the Expatriates,
as those Catalans were called who came from
parts of the country which the French possessed, offered
themselves. The two parties formed a junction that
night at Ridaura, and marched the next day, by roads
which were almost impracticable, to Oix, a village close
upon the French border. From thence they proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
on the 8th by Sadernes, Gitarriu, and Cofi, to Llorena,
taking this direction in order that the enemy and the
men themselves might be induced to believe it was their
intention to make an incursion into France. The alarm
spread along the border as they wished; the somaten
was rung; the French peasantry, and about 300 troops
of the line, collected at S. Laurent de Sardas, and remained
under arms for thirty hours. At noon on the
9th, the Catalans left Llorena, and proceeded in a
direction toward Figueras as far as the wood of Villarit,
where they concealed themselves in a glen till night
came: it had rained heavily all day, and a strong north
wind was blowing, nevertheless orders were given
that no man should kindle a fire on pain of death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rovira takes it by surprise.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>One scanty meal a day was all that could be allowed
to these hardy and patient men; but a
good allowance of generous wine had been provided
for them when it should be most needed:
this was distributed now after they had been formed
into six companies, and when night set in they advanced
to Palau-Surroca, a short hour’s distance from
the fortress. The officers of each division were men
who were well acquainted with the works; and each was
now informed what point he was to attempt, at what time,
and in what manner. At half-past two the first party
leaped into the ditch; three soldiers, who had served in
the garrison more than a year, for the purpose of performing
this service when the hour should come, opened the
gate which leads into the ditch to receive them. The
first sentinel whom they met was killed by one thrust
before he could give the alarm; the different parties
went each in its allotted direction; and so well had every
part of this enterprise been planned, and so perfectly was
it executed in all its parts, that before men, officers, or
governor, could get out of their quarters, ... almost before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
they were awakened, ... Figueras was in the hands of
the Spaniards, and its garrison, amounting to about 1000
men, were prisoners. The gate by which they had
entered was immediately walled up to guard against any
counter-surprise; and as Rovira, being a native of the
country, and conspicuous in it since the commencement
of the war, was better known than Martinez, orders
were sent out in his name, and signed by his hand,
calling upon the men of the adjoining country to come
and strengthen the garrison. His signature left no
doubt of an event which they could else hardly have
been persuaded to believe, so much was it beyond their
hopes, and in a few hours men enough were assembled
there to man the works.</p>

<p>There were about 700 of the enemy in the town, who
supposed at first that the stir which they perceived in
the castle was merely some quarrel between the French
and the Italians of whom the garrison was composed.
One of them went to ascertain this; he was asked
<i>Quien vive?</i> as he approached, and upon his replying
“France,” was fired at and shot. Upon this the French
commandant sent a trumpeter, who was ordered to
return and tell his master, on the part of General Martinez
and Colonel Rovira, that no Frenchman must
again present himself before the fortress, or he would
be answered at the cannon’s mouth. Martinez immediately
sent off a dispatch in brief but characteristic
language: “Glory to the God of armies, and honour to
the brave Catalans, St. Fernando de Figueras is taken;
Rovira had the happiness of directing the enterprise,
and I of having been the commander.” The Doctor-Colonel,
in a private letter which found its way to the
press, alluded to the ridicule which had been cast upon
his project: “The <i>Rovirada</i> is made,” said he, “and
the great fortress is ours!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rovira rewarded with church preferment.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Rovira needed no other reward than the place in history
which the success of this <i>Rovirada</i> secured
for him; but it was not the less becoming
that the government should express their
sense of his services. Some little time after, the dignity
of Maestre-Escuela, which is equivalent to that of
prebend in the English church, fell vacant in the cathedral
of Vich. A decree had past in the preceding year
for leaving unfilled such ecclesiastical offices as could,
without indecency, be dispensed with, and applying
their revenues to the public use as long as the necessities
of the country should require. The Regency
applied to the Cortes to dispense with this law for the
present occasion only, that they might confer the vacant
dignity upon Rovira, as the most appropriate testimony
of national gratitude; that when the bloody struggle in
which they were engaged against the tyrant of Europe
should have terminated happily, as was to be expected,
they said, he might have a decorous retirement suitable
to his profession, and an establishment for that
time in which, indispensably, he ought to renounce the
military honours and dignities with which he was now
decorated, but which, in any other than the actual circumstances,
were incompatible with his ministerial character.
Arguelles declared, that the Doctor Brigadier
(for to this rank he had then been promoted) was
worthy in the highest degree of national gratitude; but
he wished that any mode of remuneration should be
devised rather than one which involved the suspension
of a law, ... too perilous an example not to be carefully
avoided. But Creus observed, that Rovira, who was a
priest as much in heart as in profession, would value
this prebend more than any military rank which could
be conferred upon him; and more even than the archdeanery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
of Toledo, because it was in his own country.
And he argued, that no injury could accrue to the state, as
the income might be reserved for the treasury while the
existing circumstances continued. Garcia Herreros was
of opinion that the reward ought to be of the nature of
the service; the soldier should have a military recompense,
the priest a clerical one; he proposed, therefore,
that as the order of St. Fernando had just been
instituted, Dr. Rovira should be the first person who
should be invested with it; and that when the war
was ended one of the best prebends should then be
given him. The proposal of the Regency, however,
was adopted, and Rovira was made Maestre-Escuela of
the cathedral of Vich, for having recovered Figueras.</p>

<p>Had the Catalans been equally successful at Barcelona,
all their losses would have been more than compensated;
the success which they had gained excited
the greatest exultation, not only in Catalonia, but
throughout the whole of Spain. Te Deum was sung at
Tarragona, and the town was illuminated three successive
nights. In Madrid the Spaniards could scarcely
dissemble their joy. In the Cortes the news was welcomed
as the happiest which had been received since
the battle of Baylen; and the Regency called upon
the people for fresh contributions and fresh efforts to
improve this unexpected success, the first of its kind
which had been obtained during the war. The army
which had achieved it, they said, was in want of every
thing; and the two Regents who were in Cadiz (Blake
being absent) set the example themselves by contributing
each a month’s salary. It was, indeed, a success
which, if the Spaniards had been able, or their
allies alert enough to have improved it, might have been
a far more momentous advantage than the victories of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Barrossa and Albuhera. The first report appeared
incredible to the French generals; when it was confirmed,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suchet refuses to send the troops which Macdonald required from him.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Macdonald called upon Suchet to send
him by forced marches that part of the army of
Catalonia which he had placed under his command;
unless this were done, he said, Upper
Catalonia was lost: for neither Rosas, Gerona,
nor Hostalrich, were provisioned, and the consequences
of this cruel event were incalculable; and Maurice
Mathieu, who commanded in Barcelona, instructed the
governor of Lerida to be ready with provisions for these
troops upon their way, not doubting but that Suchet
would see the necessity of the measure in which he was
called upon to concur. But when that general had recovered
from the first grief and astonishment which the
news excited, he considered that part of these troops being
employed in an expedition among the mountains,
and the others along the Ebro to protect its navigation,
from twenty to five and twenty days must elapse before
they could receive orders from Zaragoza, assemble at
Lerida, and march from thence by Barcelona to Figueras;
during which interval the Spaniards would
have done all they could do for storing and garrisoning
the place. All the French could do was to blockade it
with the troops which were nearest at hand: those from
a distance would arrive too late, and there would then
be the difficulty of supporting them in a part of the
country stripped of its resources. If the Spaniards
should fail in endeavouring to throw sufficient supplies
into the fortress which they had surprised, the unexpected
success with which they were now so greatly elated
would in the end be little to their advantage: it would
even facilitate his operations against Tarragona, for
Campoverde would doubtless move his army towards
the Ampurdan, instead of endeavouring to interrupt the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
investment of that city; to hasten that investment,
therefore, and press the siege would be the best service
which he could render to the French in Upper Catalonia:
this opinion he thought Buonaparte would form,
whom the intelligence would reach at Paris five or six
days before he had received it at Zaragoza: upon that
opinion, therefore, he resolved to act, on his own responsibility;
and he had soon the satisfaction of knowing
that his conduct in so doing was approved and<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> applauded.</p>

<p>His judgment was not less accurate as to what was,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mémoires, 1. 13–18.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

in this instance, to be expected from the Spaniards,
who were still destined to suffer for the
weakness of their government, the want of union in their
leaders, and the want of system which was felt in every

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eroles introduces troops into Figueras.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

department. Eroles, indeed, acted on this
emergency as he always did, with promptitude,
and vigour, and ability. Collecting all the
force he could, he hastened from Martorell to reinforce
the garrison of Figueras, and on his way took the forts
which the French had erected in Castelfollit and Olot,
and made above 500 prisoners there. Though a considerable

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 16.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

force had already been collected to
blockade the place, he entered it on the sixth
day after its capture, with 1500 infantry, 150 horse, and
about 50 artillerymen, losing on the way some forty
killed and sixty wounded; but the French battalion,
which endeavoured to prevent his entrance, suffered

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French blockade it.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

more than a threefold loss. General Baraguay
d’Hilliers had by that time brought together
about 8000 troops for the blockade, nearly half of which
had been called off from blockading the Seu d’Urgel,
and had made a circuitous march within the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
border. All posts of minor importance they immediately
abandoned, retaining only Rosas, Gerona, and
Hostalrich, in that part of Catalonia, and even weakening
the garrison of Gerona so much, that that place
might have been recovered by a second <i>Rovirada</i>, had
there been another Rovira to conduct one. But there
was little concert among the Catalan leaders; it was
deemed fortunate that Eroles had not been obliged to
require the co-operation of another body, which from
its position he might have looked to for aid, because
there was ill blood between that body and the corps
which he commanded. His arrival was well-timed, for
the garrison was disorderly as well as weak, ... more
enterprising than wary, ... not to be restrained from
making rash sallies against the blockading force; and
they had also 1500 prisoners to guard, whom, for their
own security, they were compelled to confine so closely,
that they were in reasonable apprehension lest disease
and infection should be the consequences. But supplies
were as needful as reinforcements; wine and oil were
especially wanted. The Spaniards, with more alertness
than they often exerted, sent off a convoy of stores with
one of their frigates from Tarragona: it came into the
bay of Rosas three days after Eroles had entered the
fortress, but it had to wait off shore, vainly expecting
that a sufficient force for escorting it might be collected.
The British squadron off that coast was too weak to
afford any effectual assistance. Captain Buller, taking
immediate advantage of the enemy’s departure from
those places, had landed at Palamos, St. Feliu, Cadeques,
and Selva, embarked their guns and destroyed
their batteries; a useful service for the time, but one
which could not affect the operations on the land, and
the commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, who was
applied to for some ships of the line, could spare none<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
from his own anxious station, where all his vigilance was
required for watching those ports in France from whence
the enemy might look for reinforcements or supplies.
In Valencia, where there were most means, there was
least energy; and in Tarragona, where alacrity was not
wanting, it was necessary to wait for the new levies
before they could venture to send from thence any considerable
body of old soldiers with which Campoverde
might undertake the relief of the blockaded fortress, lest
Suchet, if his preparations for besieging that city were
anything more than a feint, should find it in a state of
insecurity and weakness.</p>

<p>That general had never been more in earnest. He

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mémoires, 2. 20.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

perceived that he could no longer look for co-operation
from the side of Catalonia in his intended
siege; from thence, however, he expected little
interruption, but he apprehended serious annoyance
from Mina; for if that enterprising chief could connect
himself with the Catalans of the upper valleys, it would
be possible for him, he thought, to draw after him so
large a part of the Aragonese, that he might cut off the
communication with France, and thus endanger the subsistence

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Attempts to destroy Mina.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the besieging army. None of the
Guerrilla leaders were placed in so dangerous
a position as Espoz y Mina. Every fortress in
Navarre was occupied by the French, and they were in
possession of all the country which surrounded it.
There was no point from which he could receive succour;
none upon which he could retire: the mountains
were his only fastnesses; and he had no resources but
what were to be found in his own genius, and in the
courage of his comrades, and in the love of his countrymen.
But this man was the Scanderbeg of his age.
Reille, the French governor of Navarre, had received
special instructions to hunt him down; and toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
close of the preceding year, the enemy had succeeded in
surprising his troop. He and the commanders of the
second and third battalions, Cruchaga and Gorriz, immediately
began to collect their scattered force, and perceiving
that their dispersion would not have been so
injurious but for want of order, they abstained awhile
from offensive operations, for the purpose of disciplining
the men. Reille hoped again to surprise them while they
were thus employed, and detached Colonel Gaudin from
Pamplona with 1500 foot and 200 horse, who was to
form a junction with an equal number, drawn from
Tudela, Caparroso, and Tafalla by Colonel Brescat, surround
Mina, and occupy all the points by which he
might endeavour to escape. Mina was informed of their
movements: before the two detachments could join, he
drew Gaudin into an ambuscade, in which forty of his
cavalry were killed, and about 100 infantry made prisoners,
he then attacked them in their position at Monreal,
drove them from it, and was about to renew the
attack upon a second position which they had taken,
when intelligence that Reille with a force from Pamplona
was hastening to Gaudin’s succour, induced him to
retire. The Guerrilla chief let his men rest one day, and
on the second attacked Brescat, who, with 1300 men
and 170 horse, occupied Aybar, part of the line within
which it was intended to surround this heroic Navarrese.
The enemy were driven successively from every
position where they attempted to make a stand, till
having fallen back two leagues, they reached the river
Aragon: the infantry crossed it by the bridge at Caseca,
the cavalry swam the stream, and thus interposed a
barrier between themselves and their pursuers, which
Mina was not able to force, being without artillery. In
this action the French left 162 men and sixty-three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
horses upon the field: their commander and about 220
men were wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 12.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Reille next sent his brother, at the head of 5000 foot
and 200 horse, against this harassing enemy.
For the last month Mina had been manufacturing
arms, ammunition, and clothing for his men, at
Lumbier, and there two thousand of the French found
him. Aware of their intention, and having concerted
measures with his officers, he did not disturb the soldiers
in the rest which they were enjoying, till the moment
arrived. Then, telling them what the force was which
was ordered against them, they exclaimed, with one
voice, that it would not be for their honour to abandon
the post without resistance, even though all France
should attack it. Two companies, under D. Juan de
Villanueva, defended the fords of the river, and repulsed
the enemy in their first attempt at crossing,
forcing them to retire with such precipitation, that some
of Mina’s men, who passed over at night to see what
they had left behind, collected more than a hundred
muskets from the field. The French took a position
which Mina was not strong enough to force, and for a
day and a half both parties kept up a fire upon each
other; by that time a reinforcement came to the enemy
from Pamplona. The river was well defended against
them, and before they won the passage they lost above
300 killed, and twice the number wounded: among
those who died of their wounds was Leon Asurmendi,
a renegade Spaniard, known by the name of <i>Conveniencias</i>,
and infamous for the crimes which he had committed
in aid of the intrusive government. Having
succeeded in crossing the river, the French chose rather
to perpetrate their usual cruelties upon the inhabitants
of Lumbier than follow Mina, who retired without loss,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
and in the best order. They obtained information from
some traitors of the place where the Spaniards had their
hospital; but Cruchaga and Gorriz were too vigilant to
let it be surprised, and when the enemy approached
they were so warmly received that they were driven
back the four hours’ march to Lumbier, leaving on the
way sixty killed, many wounded, and twelve prisoners.</p>

<p>Mina was at this time raising a fourth battalion; the
French sent a detachment to cut it off before it should
be completely formed. Four hundred and fifty men,
destined for this service, proceeded against the village
of Echarri-Aranaz, where the commandant of the battalion,
D. Ramon de Ulzurrun y Eraso, had only about
one hundred to oppose them. He left the village, and
disposed his handful of men so judiciously, for the
double purpose of concealing their numbers and annoying
the enemy, that the French dared not enter the
place, and during the night the officers did the piquet
duty themselves, being afraid to trust their soldiers.
“Reams of paper,” Mina said, “would not suffice for
the details of all the skirmishes in which he and his
party were engaged, ... for every day, and sometimes
twice or thrice in the day, they were occurring.”</p>

<p>The more the enemy suffered from this band, the
more efforts they made for its destruction, and towards
the close of January, Mina was again surrounded. But
this lion was not to be taken in the toils. His first
measure was to determine upon a point of reunion, and
with that spirit which made him so truly formidable to
the usurpers of his country, he fixed upon the mountains
immediately above Pamplona. Here, having overcome
every difficulty that a vigilant and powerful
enemy could interpose, Mina collected his gallant
companions: still the pursuers were on all sides; there
was not a point which he could occupy without being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
attacked, neither could he remain in that position; and
2000 men, with a proportionate cavalry, sallied from
Pamplona to dislodge him. Mina had not waited for
this: knowing that there was no escape but by becoming
the assailant, he sent Gorriz to El Carrascal, upon the
left of the city, to call the attention of the enemy in that
direction, and fall upon any convoy or escort which
might be upon the road. This movement succeeded perfectly:
the troops which were advancing had proceeded
little more than a mile when they were hastily recalled
by the alarm which Gorriz had raised in another quarter,
and the governor, thinking that Mina was on that
side, and that the other roads were secure, ordered a
convoy of sixty carts with ammunition and stores to set
out for Vitoria; 200 men escorted it, and 1000 men
followed at about an hour’s interval: ... in Navarre distance
is commonly expressed by time ... the best measure
in so mountainous a country.</p>

<p>When Mina received intelligence that this convoy was
setting out, his men were fasting, and they were three
hours’ march from the position which it was proper to
occupy for intercepting it. Leaving Cruchaga with the
main body, he set off with the horse and two companies
of foot; but the convoy had passed the place where he
meant to attack it before he could come up. The horsemen,
however, fell upon its escort, and they, abandoning
the carts, took possession of an adjoining height,
where they defended themselves, relying upon the
greater force in their rear, and likewise upon assistance
from the fortress of Irurzun, which was only at half an
hour’s distance. Mina had no time to complete their
destruction; it was of more importance for him to secure
the ammunition, more precious in his circumstances than
the richest booty, and for this there was little leisure; ...
on two sides the enemy were approaching in force, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
the escort was ready to assail him on the third. Night
came on, and on all sides there was firing; his men became
mingled with the enemy, and sometimes engaged
one another. But when Mina had succeeded in collecting
his men, and would have contented himself with
drawing them off in safety, and destroying the stores, a
general cry arose that they would rather perish than
leave behind them what they should make so useful.
The men, therefore, loaded themselves with cartridges,
of which, after each man had stored himself, they carried
off more than 60,000. Other effects, however
tempting, they regarded not: but, spoiling what they
could, and setting fire to the powder carts, they drew off
in safety with their precious plunder. The joy of Mina
and his comrades for this success was clouded by one of
those fatal accidents for which even a soldier is not prepared:
Gorriz that day, in leading on his troops, was
thrown from his horse, and lived only long enough to go
through the last ceremonies of the Romish superstition:
however worthless these were to the sufferer, the
thought that his salvation was thus secured was the consolation
of his comrades, and probably of no little importance
in keeping up their hopes and their belief in the
protection of Heaven. Mina spoke of his loss with the
deepest sorrow, a sorrow which was felt by all his
fellows in arms, whom he had more than once led on to
victory, and sometimes saved from destruction.</p>

<p>Mina was now in that perilous stage of his progress,
when every new exploit, adding to his celebrity without
adding to his strength, served to increase his danger, by
exasperating afresh the enemy, and exciting them to
make greater efforts to destroy him. In Aragon, as well
as in Navarre, the French troops were put in motion to
hunt him down, by night and day, like a wild beast.
Harispe occupied the bridges of Sanguessa, Galipienzo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
and other passes into Aragon; Panatier with another
division watched La Ribera de los Arcos, Estella, and its
vicinity; and three moveable columns kept up the chase.
The first impulse of the Navarrese hero, when he found
himself thus beset, was to attack the enemy; but for this
he was too weak. Turning back, he marched above
Pamplona by El Carrascal, and there he discovered that
two of their columns were close at hand; upon this he
countermarched towards Lumbier. Harispe was informed
of his movements, and at Irurozqui Mina found

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Feb. 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the French in his front: his men had made long
and rapid marches for the three preceding days,
nevertheless they prepared for battle with their wonted
resolution. Before the firing began Harispe sent a
cavalry officer with a flag, which Cruchaga, who went
out to meet him as an enemy, discovered just in time as
he levelled a pistol at him. The Frenchman said, he had
matters of great importance to treat of, and Mina therefore
came to hear them. His errand related to the treatment
of prisoners; it was believed in the French army that
Mina’s soldiers gave no quarter, and he came to request
that this practice might no longer be continued. Mina
on his part disclaimed the system which was imputed to
him, and required a like declaration on the part of the
enemy; to which the French officer replied, that his
general was distinguished for humanity, and that all the
officers of that division had received orders to treat such
of Mina’s men as might fall into their hands as prisoners
of war, since they now knew that they did not deserve
to be styled brigands, but defenders of their country.
Mina observed in his dispatches, that this officer behaved
with perfect courtesy, and with more honour than
was usual for a Frenchman; and he clearly perceived
that this acknowledgment of the rights of war proceeded
not from the humanity of the general, but from the discontent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
of the miserable men under his command, whom
Buonaparte and his agents in Spain sent to butcher or
to be butchered.</p>

<p>An affair ensued, in which Harispe lost half his
cavalry in vainly attempting to break the Spaniards.
Five times he attacked their position, and was as often
repulsed; but Mina perceiving that a movement was
made to cut off his retreat, withdrew in time, in good
order, and keeping up a brisk fire. This continued till
evening closed; night set in with fogs, and the French
and Spaniards got confused and intermingled, firing
upon their comrades: at length the latter retired into
a difficult pass, where the enemy did not venture to
follow them. Mina now determined, with the advice of
Cruchaga and his other officers, to break up his force
into companies, sending each to a different point; a
measure which would distract the attention of the enemy,
who would thus lose sight of him, withdraw perhaps
part of their troops, and divide the others, and thus give
him opportunity to collect his companions again, and
strike a blow when it was not expected. He himself
retained only twenty horsemen, with whom he meant
to make a circuit to preserve order among his scattered
bands, and prevent excesses of any kind. After awhile
he came to a village near the French border, where
some of his companions had stationed themselves, and
where he hoped to give a little rest to his comrades;
but an overpowering force was brought against him,
and he, again dispersing his infantry, went with his
little band of horsemen into France. Here he found
that his name was known, and his virtues honoured by
the mountaineers, while every heart cursed the tyrant
who inflicted curses upon Europe, and brought disgrace
as well as misery upon France, by the crimes which he
compelled her to perpetrate. They offered all they had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
to the Spaniards, but Mina would suffer nothing to be
taken without paying its fair price.</p>

<p>It was not long before the French discovered with
astonishment, that Mina had entered France; they dispatched
forces against him, which he eluded, and, wandering
about the borders of Roncesvalles, Viscarret, and
Olbayceta, surprised one of their parties, killing two
officers and seven men. A handful of men only were
engaged, ... but it was a well-timed success, and an
auspicious scene, and Mina said, that the Spanish spirit
of old times shone in his comrades that hour. A greater
force, to which the fugitives had given the alarm, followed
him during the whole night, but without success;
and he continued among the mountains within the French
border, waiting impatiently for better prospects. “From
thence,” says he, “I stretched my eyes over this kingdom
close at hand, covered with innumerable enemies,
and I groaned for her miserable condition; the imprisonment
of so many of its good inhabitants, the persecution
and the banishment of the relations of my
companions rent my soul, seeing myself without the
means for redressing their wrongs.”</p>

<p>But the opportunity which he expected, and which he
provided by his retreat, soon occurred; the greater part
of the troops which had been sent against him returned
toward Zaragoza, and so well had Mina instructed his
officers, and so well did they execute their instructions,
that when he re-entered Navarre, his whole band were
re-assembled within four-and-twenty hours. “It would
not have been strange,” he said, “if some of the men,
closely pursued as they had been, and dispersed in scattered
parties, as the only means of safety, had returned
home; but only a very few, who were sick, had done
this, and of them not a man without his officer’s permission.”
During this long pursuit, the enemy, less<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
accustomed to fatigues and privations than the hardy
mountaineers of Spain, suffered a tenfold greater loss
than they inflicted; above 1000 of their men were invalided,
and as many more wounded in the incessant
skirmishes which took place.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 18.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A seasonable supply of flints, cartridges, and other
necessaries, was sent at this time to Mina by the
Junta of Aragon. He was soon seen at the
gates of Estella; from that city he decoyed a hundred
of the garrison, by showing only a few of his men, whom
they sallied to cut off; then he rose upon them, killed
half their number, and took the rest prisoners under the
very walls of the fortress, not one escaping. A letter
from Reille to Marshal Bessieres was intercepted shortly
afterwards, in which he said, “that by this imprudence
of the governor of Estella, they had lost more men in
one foolish affair, than they had taken from the enemy
during a pursuit of two months. The brigands,” he
added, “had so many partisans, that their sick and
wounded were in all parts of the country, and yet it
was impossible to detect them: the public spirit was
very bad, and the business could never be completed in
Navarre, till a place of deportation was appointed for all
the relations and connexions of the brigands, and strong
escorts along the road to convoy them thither.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 23.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Renewing their efforts for the destruction of an enemy
who became every day more popular among his
oppressed countrymen, the French attacked
Mina a few days after his exploit before Estella, near
Arcos. His inferiority in numbers was compensated by
his perfect knowledge of every foot of the ground, the
experience of his officers in their own mode of warfare,
and his confidence in all his followers. After an action
which continued nearly the whole day, he drew off in
good order, and scarcely with any loss, having killed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
and wounded nearly 400 of the enemy. They obtained

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

a reinforcement, and renewed the attack on the
third day at Nacar, where he occupied a strong
position, and where he succeeded in repulsing them,
with the loss of forty killed, about 200 wounded, and
seventeen prisoners. He now entered Aragon, and
while one part of his force, under Cruchaga, approached
Zaragoza, Mina, with three companies and a few horse,
surprised a party of the enemy consisting of 152 gendarmes
and twenty-eight cavalry: the horses, the commander,
another officer, and seventy-seven of the soldiers,
were made prisoners, all the rest fell, not a man escaping.
Successes of this kind made Mina dangerous in more
ways than one to the invaders. Germans, Italians, and
even French deserted to him. In the course of five days
fifteen hussars came over with their arms and horses,
and fourteen foot soldiers, besides some poor <i>juramentados</i>,
who were happy in an opportunity of joining their
countrymen.</p>

<p>The Junta of Valencia sent him a timely supply of
arms; he issued his proclamations through Navarre, and
a man was soon found for every musket. Another
convoy from Valencia was on its way, and had to cross
the Ebro in front of Calahorra. Mina set forth to secure
its passage, leaving one battalion at Puente la Reyna to
observe the enemy in Pamplona, and another at Carcar
to cover Lodosa, which the enemy occupied, and from
whence he apprehended most danger. When he reached
the river he stationed part of his little force upon the
left bank to guard against any attack from Lodosa, on
that side also, and with two companies forded, meaning
to attack a body who occupied a village on the other
side, about a league from the ford. They fled at his
approach, leaving some of their effects behind them:
150 horse also, who were in Calahorra, fled to Lodosa;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
and the passage being thus freed, Mina received his
convoy, and returned the same night to Estella, ... for
the French after their late loss had evacuated that city,
and he made it at this time his head-quarters.</p>

<p>Well had it been for Spain if all the supplies which
the Juntas of Aragon and Valencia raised had been as
well employed as the little portion allotted to Espoz y
Mina. The French were now so well aware of the
superiority of his followers over their troops in personal
conflict, that they never moved against him without
artillery. In his mode of warfare it was impossible for
him to be provided with equal arms; but one of his
men, by name Josè Suescun y Garcia, contrived to fix
three barrels upon one stock and fire them by one lock;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 17.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

they carried two ounce balls, and were found
to succeed well the first trial, which was in an
action fought by Cruchaga near Tafalla, with an inferior
force against 1500 foot and 180 horse. Between 300
and 400 of the enemy were killed and wounded, and
twelve were made prisoners, whom Mina, upon the proposal
of the French, joyfully exchanged for an equal
number of his own men.</p>

<p>At this time the Intruder went to Paris, for the ostensible
purpose of being present at the baptism of Buonaparte’s
son. Mina was on the watch to incommode him,
as he said, upon his journey; but this wretched man
was too well aware of the danger not to take every possible
precaution, and occupied every place along the
road with a strong force before he ventured to advance.
Mina had still his eye upon this road; and shortly
afterwards, when 6000 of the enemy from Pamplona
and Tudela were about to make a combined movement
for the purpose of dislodging him from Estella, he abandoned

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 22.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that place to them, as if in fear of their
numbers, and with the whole of his force entered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
the province of Alava. He himself, with three of
his four battalions and the cavalry, reached Orbizu, the
first village in that province, on the morning of the next
day; the fourth proceeded by a different route. Here
he received information that Massena was expected at
Vitoria, on his way to France, with an escort of 2000
men, after his defeat at Fuentes d’Onoro. The hope of
meeting with one who had been called the Child and
Favourite and Angel of Victory delighted Mina, and he
set off immediately in hopes of intercepting him; but
Cruchaga, overcome by an illness against which he had
borne up for many days, was most reluctantly compelled
to remain behind.</p>

<p>At five in the evening of the 24th they reached the
Puerto de Azazeta, and halted there till it was dark, lest
they should be seen by the enemy or some of his scouts,
in passing some plains which were at no great distance
from Vitoria. Mina would not enter any village on his
way, for the French, under pain of rigorous punishment,
had enjoined all persons to give intelligence of his
movements; and he was careful not to compromise the
people. On the 25th, at four in the morning, he
reached Arlaban, the mountain which forms the boundary
between Alava and Guipuzcoa, and here he chose
his ground, placing one battalion in the woods on the
left of the road, two on the right, and the cavalry upon
the plain; the fourth he meant to station in a grove
when it should arrive, from whence it might surprise the
enemy’s rear-guard. There was a little village near,
about six miles only from Vitoria; and, that no information
might be given by any of the inhabitants, he
marched them all off, old and young, into the mountains,
and placed a guard over them, ordering them to
remain quiet for eight hours as they valued their lives.</p>

<p>Soon after these preparations were made, a messenger<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
reached him with news that Massena had arrived at
Vitoria, and would halt there; but that a great convoy
was on the point of setting out, with a general in one
coach, a colonel and lieutenant-colonel and two women
in another, 1100 prisoners, and an escort of 2000 foot
and 200 horse. The hope of delivering the prisoners
repaid him for the disappointment of his design against
Massena. Not trusting too implicitly to the messenger,
for fear of deceit, he ordered him to be bound to a point
of the rock, and placed a guard over him, who was to
put him to death if he attempted to escape, but he promised
him a munificent reward if his information should
be verified. They were not long in suspense. About
eight o’clock the enemy’s van appeared, ... 100 foot and
twenty horse, who were allowed to pass unmolested; a
second party of thirty foot and twelve horse passed in
like manner, that Mina might not, by giving the alarm
too early, lose his object. The main body came next
with the prisoners, a number of carts laden with plunder,
and one of the coaches. A fire was opened upon them
from the left by one battalion, and the two others rushed
out upon them from the right. The prisoners threw
themselves upon the ground that they might not fall by
the hands of their friends; then joyfully ran to join their
deliverers. Mina went to the coach, for the purpose of
saving its passengers; the two officers, however, refusing
to surrender, defended themselves with their sabres;
one was killed; Colonel Lafitte, the other, was wounded
and made prisoner with the women. The French,
though thrown at first into confusion and dreadfully
cut up, formed with the celerity of well-disciplined and
experienced troops; 600 foot and 100 horse brought up
the rear with the other coach: upon the first fire the
coach was driven back to Vitoria, escorted by the horsemen;
the infantry remained and got possession of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
height, from whence they annoyed the Spaniards, who
were now completing their victory. Two hundred men
from the garrison of Salinas came to their succour, but
they were dislodged and driven to the gates of Salinas.
Mina’s fourth battalion did not arrive till the business
was done: the men had made a forced march of fifteen
hours and were fasting, nevertheless they joined in the
pursuit. By this time reinforcements came to the enemy
from Vitoria, and the French in Salinas being joined by
part of the garrison of Mondragon, and of all the neighbouring
posts, again showed themselves. Mina drove
them back, and then thought it advisable to secure what
he had gained; the affair had continued five hours, and
his men had neither eaten nor drank since ten in the
morning of the preceding day; he therefore retired with
his spoils to Zalduendo, six hours’ distance from the
field.</p>

<p>The French lost their whole convoy and above 1000
men, of whom about 110 only were made prisoners.
Among the slain was Valbuena, who, having formerly
been aide-de-camp to Castaños, had entered the Intruder’s
service, and distinguished himself by his cruelty to his
own countrymen. The booty was very great: Mina
reserved one load of specie for the public service, and
his men took what they could find, many loading themselves
with gold, ... the plunder which their enemies
were conveying to France. The peasants’ artillery was
tried on this day for the second time with excellent
effect; at the first discharge it brought down above
twenty of the French, and on the second dispersed a
column which had formed in the road. The loss of the
Spaniards was inconsiderable, but D. Pedro Bizarron,
who that day commanded the cavalry, was dangerously
hurt, to the great mischief of Mina and all his comrades.
Many women were taken, they were treated with respect,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
and set at liberty. Among the Spaniards who were delivered
were twenty-one officers; Garrido was one, the
leader of a Guerrilla party in Castille.</p>

<p>Mina’s first care was to place the rescued prisoners in
safety, and this could only be done by getting them into
Valencia. For this purpose he sent to Duran and the
Empecinado to co-operate with him, and pass along the
bank of the Ebro in order to protect their passage; but
Duran was too far distant, and the Empecinado was at
this time closely pressed by the enemy; he had therefore
nothing to rely on but himself. Accordingly he
made preparations for throwing a bridge over the river,
and named the place where it was to be done; the materials
were sent towards this place, and he moved in
the same direction: then in the middle of the night
turning aside marched to a part of the river twelve miles
distant, tried the depth by forcing his own horse into
the water, and making each of his cavalry take up a
man behind him, in this manner landed the whole in
safety, while the enemy were waiting to attack him
when he should be employed in making his bridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Next his band was heard of at Irun, when D. Josè
Gorriz, who, according to the Maccabean system,
had succeeded his kinsman in the command of the
third battalion, forming a junction with the fourth under
Ulzurrun, marched against that place, defeated the
garrisons of Oyarzun and Beriatu, got possession of the
stores of the Intrusive government at Irun, and burnt the
bridge which the French had constructed over the
Bidasoa, which there separates France from Spain;
after which they returned with their booty, though all
the force of the adjoining posts was collected to oppose
them. Greater and more persevering efforts were
now made to destroy him. Caffarelli arrived to take
the command in Biscay, and his first object was to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
signalize himself by the destruction of an enemy, for
whose blood Buonaparte thirsted as he had thirsted for
that of Schill and of Hofer. Mina was in the village of
Mendigorria with three of his battalions and his cavalry,
when Caffarelli with one division came against him by
Puente la Reyna, another by the Valle de Echaurri;
Reille advanced with a third by Carrascal, and a fourth
moved from Logroño upon Estella. The whole force in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

motion against him amounted to 8000 foot and
2000 horse. Mina put himself in ambush near
Carrascal, meaning to attack Reille; he engaged him,
and forced him to retire upon Tafalla: but when the
Guerrilla chief had advanced in pursuit as far as the
village of Barasoain, he discovered that Caffarelli,
marching back from Puente, had contrived to cut off
the battalion which he himself commanded, and place
it between two fires. Reille and Caffarelli then, whose
joint force amounted to 700 horse and 4000 foot, attacked
him with as great advantage of ground as of
numbers, and Mina for the moment expected to see six
of the seven companies of his battalion cut off. Their
desperate courage brought them off with the loss of
twenty-three killed and eighty taken; a heavy loss, but
far less than there had been cause to dread, ... and for
which in the action they had revenged themselves. He
himself was in the most imminent peril: a party of
hussars surrounded him, and one of them aimed a blow
which he had no other means of avoiding but by stretching
himself out upon his horse; the horse at the same
moment sprung forward and threw him; he recovered
his feet and ran; the horse, ... whether by mere good
fortune, or that, in the wild life to which Mina was reduced,
like an Arab he had taught the beast to love
him ... followed his master, who then lightly leaped into
his seat, and, though closely pursued, saved himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
He got to Lerga with his men; Reille marched to
Tafalla, Caffarelli to Monreal; each division being thus
three hours’ distance from him. The next day he moved
to Sanguesa, and rested there the whole day. On the
morrow he was apprized that Caffarelli was approaching
Lumbier and Reille Caceda, both points within two
hours of him: upon this he sent his cavalry along the
river Aragon to call off their attention in that direction,
while with the infantry he took his route for the mountains
of Biqueza. The two hostile divisions followed
him, one on the right, and the other on the left, hoping
again to place him between two fires: he had the start
of them only half an hour, and having gained the mountain,
put his men in order to defend the post; but in
the evening the enemy moved off, meaning to take him
at more advantage, and he reached the village of Veguezal.
This was on the 16th of June; the next day
he was informed that Caffarelli and Reille, with the
French from the district of the Cinco Villas, would
attack him on the 18th on the three sides of the Puerto,
Navascues, and Tiermas: he eluded them all by marching
to Iruzozgui. Caffarelli followed him as far as Artieda,
which was an hour and a half’s distance. Mina
was not informed of this: they met on the way to Aoiz;
the Spaniards had the good fortune to gain a strong
position upon some heights, where they were able to
repulse the enemy, notwithstanding his forces were
double in number, with the loss of more than 300 killed.
This gained them a day’s respite from their pursuers:
on the 20th they learnt that Reille had again joined
Caffarelli, and Mina once more resolved to divide his
force, and thus multiply the chances of escape. Cruchaga,
with the second battalion, took his course toward
Roncesvalles, and he with the first and third marched
for Zubiri. On his way he learnt that the French in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Aoiz had been 6000 foot and 700 horse, who were now
thus disposed of; 4000 were marching to Zubiri, 2000
with 400 horse to the town of Urroz, and Reille with
300 horse was gone to Pamplona; 200 who had
escorted the wounded were also on their way to Zubiri
with a supply of ammunition. Fearful as this intelligence
was, his men ate their rations with composure,
and then amidst incessant rain turned to Larrainzar; ...
from thence he sent his third battalion to Bustan, and
he himself, with the remaining one marched for the
village of Illarse. His own danger was not diminished
by this separation, for it seemed of more importance to
the enemy to secure his single person than to destroy
the troop; they followed close upon the scent: from
Illarse they pursued him to Villanueva in Araguil,
where he arrived at night, and from whence he set out
at two in the morning: as little was he able to rest at
Echarri Aranaz; from thence, through the Puerto de
Tizatraga, he made for the Puerto de Lezaun; still they
were close upon him; he got on to Los Arcos, and the
enemy halted at Estella, twelve miles distant.</p>

<p>The French had formed their plan for hunting him
down with perfect knowledge of the country, meaning to
hem him in on all sides among the mountains; and they
had assembled not only all their troops in Navarre for
this service, but had drawn soldiers from Alava also,
and from part of Castille, and were aided by reinforcements
from France. Not less than 12,000 men were
now employed against him. Mina, however, knew the
ground as well as his pursuers, and never losing hope,
and never without resources, he once more divided his
men into small moveable columns, which he dispersed
among the mountains in contrary directions, but with
such instructions, that whenever a favourable opportunity
arrived, the reunion might be effected as rapidly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
as before. The French were thus compelled either to
extend their line so far that their strength would not be
sufficient to cover it, or else to keep it together without
any object upon which they could bring it to bear. As
he expected, they found themselves at fault, and before
they knew how to act, or where to seek him, he had reunited
his three battalions and all his cavalry in Estella,
where Cruchaga, with the other battalion, hastened to
join him, after having attacked the enemy in Roncesvalles,
killed and wounded twenty-five of them, and
driven the rest into their fort.</p>

<p>Mina’s reputation was greatly raised by the ability
with which he extricated himself from so many dangers,
and the loss which he so frequently inflicted upon the
enemy; but these persevering efforts of the French had
the desired effect of rendering it impossible for him to
undertake any enterprise which might tend to the relief

of Figueras, or, by disturbing Suchet in Aragon,
operate in aid of Tarragona. That city,
one of the most remarkable in Spain for its
monuments of antiquity, and for the historical circumstances
connected with it, stands about the distance of a
musket-shot from the sea shore, on a steep and rocky

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>España Sagrada, T. 24. p. 69.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

eminence, where (in the words of Florez) it
commands and enjoys a free air, a clear sky,
and its own fertile plain. Its foundation being
in an age beyond the reach of history, has been variously
ascribed to Tubal, Hercules, Teucer, Remus, a king of
Egypt, and a colony of Phocæans, by fablers who sought
in their inventions to gratify that allowable and useful
pride which citizens learn to take in the place of their
birth and abode ... or to accredit their own theories, or
to support some baseless etymology of its name. This
alone is certain, that it was a considerable place before</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ycart. Grandezas de Tarragona, 65.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the Romans and Carthaginians contended for the dominion
of Spain; and the remains of its more

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Laborde Voyage Pittoresque. Introd. p. 31.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

ancient walls, which excited the wonder of
antiquaries in the sixteenth century, excite in
the present age their sagacity, their conjectures,
and their doubts; for, though resembling those
which are called Cyclopean in magnitude and
solidity, they differ from them in construction.
The Scipios so greatly enlarged and embellished it, as
almost to be considered its refounders; and on the division
of the Peninsula under the Romans, it gave name
to that province which had before been called Citerior
Spain. Augustus, according to fond Spaniards, issued
from Tarragona his ever memorable decree that all the
world should be taxed: here it was that the palm was
said to have grown upon his altar during his life; and
the year after his death the inhabitants sent deputies to
Rome, soliciting permission to erect a temple to him as
a god: ... a fragment of that altar, a single stone of that
temple, and a few medals, are now the only remains of
their vile and impious adulation. When Galba was declared

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suetonius.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

emperor, the crown of gold for his inauguration
was taken from the temple of Jupiter in this
city. The Egyptian Isis was worshipped here,
and the African goddess Cœlestis: and when the Romish
church had corrupted Christianity with the polytheism
and idolatry of Pagan Rome, changing the names, but
retaining the superstition, the craft, and the sin, it was
then inferred that Santiago <em>must</em> have sanctified Tarragona
by his presence, it being certain that he was at
Zaragoza when our Lady descended there with the pillar
from heaven. When the barbarians in the reign of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Orosius, L. 7. § 15.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Gallienus first entered Spain, Tarragona was
reduced by them almost to a heap of ruins; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
it was the last place in that country which the Romans
retained. Many of the Gothic kings coined money
there. It underwent a second destruction from the
Moors, in revenge for the resolution with which the
inhabitants resisted them. Louis the Pious recovered it
from them at the beginning of the 9th century, but the
Christians could not hold it long; nor is it known by
whom it was finally taken from the Mahommedans, nor
when, except that it was some time in the 11th century,
... an uncertainty, which shows how slowly it had risen

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ordericus Vitalis, 892, quoted by Florez, T. 25. p. 116.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

from its ruins. Indeed, when Oldegar was
made archbishop there, in the year 1116, large
oak and beech-trees were growing in the cathedral.
This personage, eminent during his life,
as a politic prelate and saint militant, and as a worker
of miracles after his death, refortified the city, and may
be said to have refounded it.</p>

<p>The ruined and almost desolate city, with all belonging
or which ought to belong thereunto, was given to
this prelate and his successors in the see, under the
Romish church, by the Count of Barcelona, Ramon

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Florez, T. 25. App. No. v.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Berenguer 3; the deed of gift transferring to
the archbishop full power of every kind, stipulating
only for an alliance offensive and defensive
with the Tarragonans. Oldegar, finding that after
ten years his means were not sufficient to complete the
cathedral, or to defend the city, transferred the grant to

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ordericus Vitalis, L. 13. § 5. Florez, T. 10. App. ult.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

be held as a feud under the see to a Norman
knight, Rodbert Burdet by name, who had married
in that land, and had acquired there considerable
possessions and a great name; but

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Diago. Condes de Barcelona, p. 183.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

this family, a branch whereof continues to flourish
in England, seems to have taken no root
in Spain. The tithes both of the sea and land<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
were reserved for the see: ... those of the nuts<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> alone
from the Selva de Avellana are said to have yielded in
some years a thousand escudos. Funds for completing
the cathedral, the largest and massiest in Catalonia,
were raised by a contribution which the Pope imposed
upon the suffragan bishops, and by soliciting alms in
aid of the work throughout the province: but the city
never recovered even a semblance of its former prosperity.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Florez, T. 24. 69.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Its circumference is now little more than two
miles, and the river Francoli, which, when it
bore its ancient name of Tulcis, ran close to
Tarragona, is now a mile distant from it. War had not
been the cause of this improsperity; for after its restoration,
the Moors never attempted it; it suffered little
in the revolt of the Catalans; and nothing in the Succession
War, the English being received there by the
inhabitants, and retiring from it after the peace of
Utrecht. But at the time when it might otherwise have
partaken the improvement which was then general in
Spain, the neighbouring town of Reus made an extraordinary
advance in industry and opulence, trebling its
population in the course of fifteen years; and making
Salo its port, it had the effect rather of taking from Tarragona
what trade it might have had, than of contributing
to it.</p>

<p>When this unexpected war commenced, Tarragona
was deemed so little important as a fortress, that its
garrison consisted only of fifty men; it was now the
only strong place which the Catalans possessed upon
the coast; every exertion had been made to strengthen
its works, and they who relied upon fortresses regarded
it as the last bulwark of Catalonia. The city was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
crowded with fugitives from the open country and from
towns in the enemy’s possession; there was a strong
garrison; and Tarragona had this advantage above every
other place in the province which had yet been besieged,
that supplies and reinforcements could at all
times be thrown in by sea. Captain Codrington was in
the roads with the Blake, Invincible, and Centaur, ready
to aid in any way wherein the zeal and intrepidity of
British seamen could be rendered available. Under
these circumstances, the spirit of the principality being
what it was, and Valencia with unexhausted resources
close at hand, a resolution like that of the Zaragozans
and Geronans, or an influencing mind like that of
Palafox or of Mariano Alvares, would have baffled all
the efforts of the enemy; and unity of counsels, with a
competent leader in the field, might have rendered the
siege fatal to the besiegers. There were men and
means in abundance; the inhabitants as well as the garrison
were prepared to act or to suffer; neither will nor
resolution were wanting; but there was no commanding
mind, no harmony of purpose; some hearts were accessible
to fear, and some to corruption. This Count
Suchet knew, and could calculate as certainly upon confusion
and perplexity in their counsels as upon steadiness
and method in his own.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 2.</span><br />Siege of Tarragona.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>He established his head-quarters at Reus: the inhabitants
of that busy town had been properly
rewarded for the inclination which they had
shown toward the French; and their hatred toward
them now was in proportion to their sufferings and
their repentance. Suchet endeavoured to win them
over by maintaining strict discipline, and by courting
the chief authorities, civil and religious. Expecting also
an obstinate resistance, he prepared extensive hospitals
with all things necessary to receive his wounded, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
made arrangements for removing them without delay
from the trenches; measures whereby he deserved and
obtained the affections of the soldiery in a greater degree
than any other of the French generals in Spain.
He pushed the siege with characteristic vigour, and had
soon the satisfaction to learn that Campoverde, having

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Campoverde enters the city after a defeat.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

been defeated before Figueras in attempting to
relieve that fortress, had hastened back to Tarragona
by sea with the remainder of his troops,
who were more likely to dispirit the garrison by
the distrust which they had conceived of themselves and
of their commander, than to bring any increase of real
strength. Sarsfield remained with one division in the
field, and threatened the enemy’s line from Mora to
Reus. This brave and enterprising officer annoyed
them on that side; and that part of the besieging
army which was encamped on the high and dry level
ground at a distance from the Francoli and the Gaya,
suffered for want of water, having continually to
repair and protect the aqueduct. The most important
of the outworks were Fort Francoli, on the left bank
of the river to the west of the city, and Fort Olivo: the
latter was a new fort, about 400 toises to the north, on
ground so high that it could not with safety have been
left unoccupied; and this it was deemed necessary to
reduce before any attack could be made upon the body
of the place. On the part of the enemy’s engineers
everything was done which could be expected from a
thorough practical knowledge of their destructive art;
and so vigorously were their advances resisted by
the Spaniards, that the wounded who were carried to
the French hospitals are stated by Suchet himself to
have been from fifty to threescore daily during the siege
of this outwork. The Spaniards estimated them as
nearer 300. In one of the sorties General Salme was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
killed; his body was buried under a part of the aqueduct;
his heart embalmed, and deposited under that
well-known monument which is called the Tomb of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fort Olivo betrayed.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Scipios. Olivo held out till the night of the
29th; nor would it then have been taken had
there not been found a wretch wicked enough to sell
the blood of his comrades and the interests of his country.
The garrison, consisting of 2000, was to be
changed that night, the regiment of Illiberia returning
into the town, and that of Almeira taking its place: the
French presented themselves at the same time with the
new garrison, while a false attack was made in another
quarter, and entered with them; others found their way
through a dry aqueduct, which the Spaniards had
neglected either to destroy or properly to secure, and
Fort Olivo was thus taken, some 800 Spaniards being
made prisoners, and more than as many slain. For the
information which led to this carnage a price had been
bargained, and the money<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> was paid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Contreras.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At this time General Senen de Contreras arrived at
Tarragona in a frigate from Cadiz. He had
distinguished himself when a young man, by
abridging the voluminous Military Reflections of the
Marquis de Santa Cruz, and was thought to have
studied his profession so well that he was sent by
Charles III. on a travelling mission, to examine into
the military institutions of other countries. On this
service he was employed four years, visiting England,
France, Prussia, Austria, and Russia, and in the campaign
of 1788 he served against the Turks. In the war
against revolutionary France he acted as aide-de-camp
to General Urretia in the Pyrenees; and in the present
contest had afforded a timely support to the Portugueze<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
in Alemtejo and Algarve, ... had been in the retreat of
the central army, gaining some partial successes in those
disastrous days, ... and afterwards, in some critical situations
and some important stations, supported the reputation
which he had obtained. He landed now at
Tarragona in an inauspicious hour, and had immediately
a command entrusted to him at the gate opposite Fort
Olivo, where he passed the first unhappy night after his
arrival in receiving the fugitives. On the following
morning Campoverde assembled his chief officers and
the deputies of the superior Junta: it was agreed that
an effort for raising the siege should be made in the
field; and while the general in chief should be thus

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Contreras appointed to command in the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

employed, Contreras was appointed to command
in the city. The danger of the place,
and the numerous defects of its incomplete
works, were obvious to all military men; and to no one
more clearly than to the general who now unwillingly
took upon himself the charge of defending it. He represented

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that he was neither acquainted with
the troops and officers whom he was to command,
nor with the civil authorities with whom he
should have to act, nor with the people on whose energetic
aid he must rely, nor with the place itself (of
which not even a plan could be produced), having, in
fact, none of that information which might be considered
indispensable for such a command. With this responsibility,
however, Contreras was left; and Campoverde

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Campoverde goes out to act in the field.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

departed by sea with his staff, and so many
officers (every man seeming to act at his own
pleasure), that of the regiments in the garrison
only two were left with their own colonels or proper
commanders. He issued a proclamation before his departure,
promising to return in the course of six or
eight days with an army, and make an effort, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
was to be seconded by the garrison, for raising the siege.
The new commander had no expectation that this promise
would be performed; but the garrison and the
inhabitants looked with confidence to its fulfilment, ... for
the Spaniards are a hopeful people, and, all circumstances
considered, they had on no former occasion had
such reasonable ground for hope. They had lost about
3000 men during the siege, which they supposed to be a
less loss than the French had sustained, and they could
more easily be reinforced. If, indeed, the same means
of defence had been resorted to here as in Zaragoza and
Gerona, Tarragona, defective as its works were, must
have been impregnable; it was secure against famine;
it was in no danger of pestilence; and its numbers
might always have been kept up. The enemy had
broken the aqueduct, expecting to distress the besieged
by reducing them to use the brackish water of their
wells; but in this he was deceived, for no distress was
occasioned by it. The very sight of the English squadron,
and the constant communication with it, and its
aid on all opportunities, contributed greatly to the confidence
which was felt.</p>

<p>Contreras did not partake that confidence; his measures,
however, were such as might support it. He
established a military police; he formed the inhabitants
into companies; and he employed the women in such
services as they were capable of performing. On their
part, indeed, a spirit was manifested such as the time
required; no danger deterred them from administering
refreshments to the soldiers at their stations, nor from
bearing away the wounded: it was sometimes necessary
to restrain their ardour, but on no occasion did it need
excitement. The military chest was almost exhausted;
the commander replenished it by levying a contribution
upon those merchants who had retired to Villa Nueva<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
with their effects. He gave ear to no overtures from
the enemy of whatever kind. When Suchet proposed a
suspension of hostilities, that the dead might be interred
who lay in heaps around Fort Olivo, in sight from the
ramparts of the city, even that proposal was rejected;
and in that hot season of the year, and on that rocky
soil where graves could not be dug, the French, for their
own sakes, were compelled as long as the siege continued
to consume the slain by fire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fort Francoli abandoned.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>They gave the fort which they had won the name of
Salme, from the general who had fallen before it. And
now their attacks were directed against Fort
Francoli, which they reduced at length to such
a state that the commandant found it necessary
to abandon it as untenable, destroying such stores as he
could not remove. Hitherto there had been no want of
firmness in the besieged; but vigour, confidence, and
unanimity were wanting among their leaders. Three
members of the supreme Junta were in the city, in order
that the civil power might through them afford all the
aid which the military might require: this they did most
unreservedly; but the proposals which they made met
with no correspondent consideration, and the soldiers
complained of the inaction in which they were kept.
When Campoverde first entered the place, it was supposed
that he had invested Sarsfield with powers to act
for him both as governor-general of the province and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sarsfield.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

commander in the field; but Sarsfield was soon
called after him to Tarragona, and remained
there after he had departed. This general was one of
the best officers in the Spanish service for an inferior
command, ... an intelligent, enterprising, intrepid, and
honourable man; but he was punctilious and irritable,
and thought less of his country and his duty than of his
own personal importance, ... differing in this most widely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
from Eroles, of whose high reputation and higher virtues
he was so jealous, that he regarded him with a dislike
little short of personal enmity. This same unhappy
temper made it impossible for him to act cordially with
Contreras. In the field he might have been far more
serviceable than in the fortress, for in the field it was
that the best service might have been effected, and the
French acknowledged and feared his activity as a partisan;
but though he kept up that character in the
sallies which he directed, his impractical disposition
marred all his better qualities. What he did

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cataluña Atribulada, 13.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was without consulting the governor; he
neither thought it necessary to concert operations
with him, nor even to inform him of the results.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Troops sent to reinforce the garrison, and landed elsewhere.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meantime the siege was pressed with the utmost skill
and exertions; and on the part of the Spaniards there
was as much want of concert and ability without
the walls as within. Troops were twice
sent from Carthagena to reinforce the place,
and both times without arms, so that when they
arrived they were useless, there being already 2000
men there more than there were weapons for; and
therefore by desire of Contreras they were carried on to
Villa Nueva, there to be armed, if Campoverde could
arm them, or to take their own course! And on the
part of Campoverde himself there was such uncertainty,
such seeming apathy, that the British officers, who were
exerting themselves with indefatigable zeal, apprehended
the worst consequences from the incapacity which they
now perceived in him. O’Donell, now Conde de Bisbal,
was not yet sufficiently recovered from his wound to
take the field: his services were never more needed
than at this time, when there was no lack of means or
men, only of hearts and heads to direct them. He consulted,
however, with his brother, who had a command<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
in the Valencian army, and in concert with him and
Captain Codrington it was agreed that 4000 of the best
Valencian troops should be sent in British ships to reinforce
the garrison, while the rest of that army should move
to the banks of the Ebro, and there, in concert with
the Aragonese, threaten Suchet’s depôts, the movement
which of all others he apprehended most. These troops,
under General Miranda, were accordingly embarked at
Peñiscola, with written orders to land at Tarragona; the
intention being that they should join in a sally, which
Captain Codrington thought could not fail of success.
Miranda, however, refused to land, protesting that both
his written and verbal instructions forbade him to shut
himself up in the fortress with his division. This was
neither the place nor the time for disputing; and as
little good service can be expected from one in whom
good will is evidently wanting, the division landed at
Villa Nueva, according to Campoverde’s desire, that
they might join him at Igualada, and act upon the besiegers’
flank.</p>

<p>Suchet, meantime, was not without uneasiness: he
had already lost 2500 men, including 280 officers; and
hitherto the chief advantage which he had gained had
been obtained less by force of arms than by corruption.
But the feeble irresolution of the Spanish leaders and
their ruinous delays gave him time, by which he profited
like one who knew its value; and on the evening of the
21st he assaulted the lower town; three breaches had
been made, and with all its defences, it was in the course
of an hour in his hands, at the cost of about 500 men.
It is said that the same means for insuring success had
been provided here as at Fort Olivo<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>. With the exception<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
of a small number, all the Spaniards were put

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The lower town taken.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to the sword in the town, at the port, in the
houses, and in pursuit ... to the gates of the upper
town; only 160 prisoners were taken, most of whom
were wounded; no more than these were spared, while
the number of bodies which the French collected and
burnt amounted to 1350. Suchet then held forth a
threat which he had now shown, that the troops whom
he commanded were capable of carrying into effect: “I

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suchet’s threat.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

fear much,” said he, “that if the garrison wait
for the assault in their last hold, I shall be
forced to set a terrible example, and intimidate Catalonia
and Spain for ever by the destruction of a whole
city!”</p>

<p>Sarsfield, who was slightly wounded in this action,
embarked immediately to join Campoverde and act in
the field; this he did without informing Contreras of
his intention, and at a moment when his presence was
more needful than it had been at any former time. An
officer was appointed to succeed him as soon as his departure
was known; but before that officer could repair
to his post, the enemy had forced it, and were

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The mole at Tarragona.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

masters of the mole. Ten years had not quite
elapsed since that port had been a scene of proud rejoicing,
the King and Queen of Spain having visited it
to inspect the works at the mole, which having been
commenced in the year 1790, were then on the point of
completion. The quarries being near at hand, an enormous
stone had been prepared for this occasion, on
which an image of Neptune, ten feet high, was placed,
with one hand reining the dolphin on which he stood,
with the other holding his trident. The huge mass was
raised by the exertions of three hundred men, and let
down into its place in the sea. Neptune descending
with it as into his own empire, amid the sound of music,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
and the festive discharge of artillery, and the exulting
acclamations of myriads of beholders. The beach
which on that day had been lined with happy multitudes
was soon to become the scene of the most atrocious
tragedy in this whole dreadful war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Campoverde’s inactivity.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Junta of Tarragona were now so indignant at the
conduct of Campoverde, whose futile movements
at this crisis were as injurious as his
inactivity, that they enclosed to him his own
proclamation, issued at the time of his departure, wherein
he had promised to relieve them in the course of a
few days. Three weeks had now elapsed; he had been
reinforced with 4000 Valencian troops on whom he had
not counted when that promise was made; and there
was a general outcry against his unfitness for the command.
Eroles alone acted with the spirit which the
exigence required, and succeeded in capturing a convoy
of 500 laden mules between Mora and Falset, and cutting
off part of their escort. Wherever his services
were most needed there he was always to be found, ...
seeking as little to aggrandize as to spare himself, his
single object being the deliverance of his country. The
magazines at Reus were not so well provided but that
the loss of these supplies would have been felt by the
besiegers, if the city had been defended after the manner
of Gerona. But the Geronans were commanded by
a man of the old heroic stamp, and they had no base
examples to discourage them: whereas the garrison and
the people of Tarragona saw nothing in the conduct of
their leaders and their countrymen but what was disheartening.
While the gun-boats and launches of the
British squadron were employed every night, and all
night long, in annoying the enemy’s working parties,
there were two Spanish frigates which remained quiet
spectators. While the English were removing women,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
children, and wounded, in their transports to Villa

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ill behaviour of the Spanish frigates.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Nueva, those frigates would not receive on
board their wounded countrymen who were sent
off to them; and these poor creatures were left
to lie without assistance of any kind in the boats which
brought them off till relief was sent them from the
British ships. This heartless disregard of all duty
called forth strong remonstrances from General Doyle, as
well as from Captain Codrington; and it was not till
above 2000 people had been removed in our transports
that the positive orders of Contreras, and the threat of
General Doyle, that the captain of one of their frigates
should be put under arrest if he refused to receive the
wounded, compelled them to act as if they had some
sense of honour and humanity. Had the Spaniards in
the fortress and in the field displayed as much spirit and
alacrity as was manifested by the British ships in their
aid, Contreras has declared that Tarragona could not
have been taken.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col. Skerret arrives with British troops.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Suchet meantime pushed his attacks vigorously
against the only remaining defences of the city,
aware that he had no time to lose, and that
if preparations were made for defending the
streets and houses, a war of that kind might detain
him till efficient succours should arrive by sea. Sir
Edward Pellew, who had just taken the command of the
Mediterranean fleet, was hastening with all speed to
assist the besieged; and when the enemy’s batteries for
forming a breach were almost completed, a detachment
of 2000 British troops under Colonel Skerret arrived
from Cadiz in the bay. He landed with his engineers,
and they perceived how ill the front which the French
threatened was able to withstand such batteries as would
presently be opened against it. There was but one
point now at which a disembarkation could be effected,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
and that point was flanked by the enemy. The disembarkation
would nevertheless have been made, and
these troops would have saved Tarragona, or fallen in
its defence, if Contreras had not recommended that they
should co-operate with Campoverde from without: their
presence, he thought, might goad that general on to
action, and give reasonable hope of some decisive success
in the field, from which alone he looked for deliverance.
Besides, he said, the garrison was numerous
enough; and as soon as the enemy should have opened
their trenches, and begun to batter in breach, he had
determined to abandon the place, thinking it of more
importance to preserve 7000 fine troops, than to defend
the ruins of Tarragona. Skerret, therefore, met Eroles,
who came from Campoverde; and they agreed with
Doyle and Codrington, that the best plan would be for a
sally to be made from the town with 4000 men, and
Skerret at the same time to land and join in it. But
when they came to consult with Campoverde himself
and with Sarsfield, doubts and difficulties were started;
other schemes were proposed, discussed, and rejected,
and at length a written project of Campoverde’s was
assented to. He had just before required 3000 of the
best troops from the garrison: Contreras said, he would
not commit such an error as to send them: he sent,
however, one of the regiments which had been specified.
Meantime, precious hours were let pass unprofitably by
the Spaniards, and the French the while were unremittingly
active in their operations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tarragona taken by assault.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 28th a breach had been made between two
bastions capable of only two, or, at the most,
three men abreast. That afternoon there was a
strong cannonade: it ceased, and a dispatch
came off from Contreras to the squadron, saying that the
British guns had silenced the enemy’s batteries, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
very little harm had been done to the place, and that
the breach was nothing; yet he said, knowing the city
was not tenable, he had determined upon leaving it with
the garrison next day. While the British officer was
reading this dispatch, the enemy were seen from the
ships storming the breach, and in half an hour the place
was carried. The Spaniards, disheartened by all the
previous events of the siege, ... betrayed by some, and
by others deceived and disappointed, ... abandoned themselves
now: they were seized with a sudden panic; ...
and there is nothing to alleviate, nothing to mingle with
and modify the horror wherewith the ensuing tragedy
will be regarded as long as the history of these times
shall be held in remembrance. The scene was shameful
as well as shocking. Instead of maintaining the
breach, as the people of Gerona had done when suffering
under disease and famine; instead of attempting to
cut their way through the enemy, which at one time had
less wisely and less generously been intended, the soldiers
fled. Without the satisfaction of selling their lives
dearly, or the sense of duty to console them in death,
they suffered themselves to be butchered without resistance.
Some of the officers tried every means to rally
their men, but such efforts were in vain; that moral
discipline had been neglected by which Zaragoza and
Gerona have rendered themselves for ever worthy of
admiration. The governor of the place, Gonzalez, with
a handful of brave men, defended himself till the last,
and fell. Contreras was wounded, and taken prisoner.
The last effort was made before the cathedral, whither
a multitude of Spaniards had betaken themselves; some
in the vain hope that the sanctity of the place might
protect them, some that they might die before their
altars, and some to avail themselves of the vantage
ground afforded by the ascent, which is by a flight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
threescore steps. The conquerors made their way up
under a destructive fire; and their fury, according to
Suchet, knew no bounds, till upon entering the cathedral
they beheld nine hundred wounded lying on the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mémoires, 2. 105.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

pavement. Their bayonets, he says, respected
them; and he commends what he calls this
trait of humanity. Little was shown elsewhere; but
the carnage was chiefly among the inhabitants. Many
thousands who had got over the ramparts or through the
embrasures, or through the gate of St. Antonio, fled
along the beach. The French field artillery and the
batteries opened a fire upon this mixed and flying multitude
on one part; and on another the cavalry charged
among them, sabring the women and children, and
trampling them down.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Massacre at Tarragona.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These execrable conquerors kept up a heavy fire upon
the landing-place, where women and children
stood grouped together, crowding to the British
boats; and they endeavoured to sink the boats
that were employed in this service of humanity. Suchet
stated in his official account that four thousand men
were killed in the city, and a thousand sabred or
drowned in endeavouring to make their escape, ... “a
horrible massacre had been made,” he said, “with little
loss on the side of the conquerors; the terrible example
which he had foreseen had taken place, and would be
long remembered in Spain!” From the Spaniards and
from our own officers we learned what was the nature of
this example, which, because it was threatened, must be
believed to have been predetermined! More than 6000
unresisting persons were butchered; old and young,
man and woman, mother and babe; and when the
enemy had satiated their thirst for blood they turned to
the perpetration of crimes more damnable than murder.
In the streets and in the churches they violated women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
who had escaped their first fury, only to suffer now
worse horrors before they died. Nuns and wives, and
widows in the hour when they were widowed, girls and
children, were seized on by these monsters, ... and, retaining
their cruelty when rage and lust were palled,
they threw many of these victims, and of the wounded
Spaniards, into the burning houses.</p>

<p>There were officers in this accursed army whose
hearts revolted at the wicked service in which they
were engaged, and who at all times redeemed themselves
as far as they could by acts of individual humanity.
What little mercy was shown at Tarragona ...
little indeed it was, ... was owing to such men. But General
Suchet was of the school of terrorists<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>; his intention
was to intimidate Catalonia and the whole of Spain by
this terrible example; and on the following morning he
ordered the Alcaldes and Corregidores from the surrounding
country to be brought together and led through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
the streets of Tarragona, that they might see the bodies

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Contreras, p. 72.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

which were lying there, and report to their
countrymen what they might expect if they
dared attempt resistance to the French! If, indeed, at

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Campoverde resolves to abandon Catalonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

any time it were possible to intimidate such a
people as the Catalans, who in all ages have
shown the same invincible resolution, it would
have been now, when the last bulwark of the province
had fallen. By some strange imprudence the greater part
of their ammunition had been deposited there, and very
little remained in those parts of the country which were
yet free. There still remained in the field the remains
of an army which they had clothed and armed at their
own cost, as well as raised among themselves; and
which, often as it had been defeated, had nevertheless
shown a braver countenance to the enemy, and inflicted
upon him greater loss than any other in the Spanish

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 1.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

service. The general, however, held a council
of war at Cervera; the usual course when a
commander wishes to shift from himself the ignominy
of the measures which he is prepared to take. It was
proposed to abandon the province, as if farther resistance
were hopeless. Eroles was not present; and though
Sarsfield, who was the first to give his opinion, declared
that any one who should vote for such an abandonment
would be a traitor to his country, and that he and his
division would stand or fall with the principality, he
received only a faint and false support from Campoverde,
and was consequently outvoted; and an aid-de-camp of
the general was sent to inform Captain Codrington that
they were on their march to Arens, there to embark,
leaving their horses on the beach. Codrington replied,
that having brought the Valencians thither for a special
service, he felt himself bound in duty to take their division
on board, and return them to the general and kingdom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
by which they had been spared; but that he would
not embark the army of Catalonia, and thus make himself
a party concerned in the abandonment of a province
which he was sent to protect. Upon receiving this answer,
Campoverde determined upon marching into Aragon,
... not upon any brave attempt, but for the chance
of making his way into some safer country; a determination
which so dismayed the Valencians, that nearly
2000 of them dispersed, as well knowing how much
better they could shift for themselves individually than
they were likely to fare in such an undertaking. The
commander now began to perceive that as the English
would not take away his army by sea, neither would
the troops follow him by land; and there was a general
call that Eroles should take upon himself the command.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eroles refuses to leave it.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

But Eroles, who acted always from a worthier
motive than ambition, replied to the Junta of
generals who would have conferred it upon him
in obedience to the voice of the people, that as long as
any of those who were his superior officers remained in
the principality, he must decline it; but that whenever,
in pursuance of the resolution which had been taken,
they should pass the boundaries, he would then, however
unwillingly, take upon him that duty, rather than
see his country thrown into the worse anarchy which
must otherwise ensue.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Lacy arrives to take the command.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>That anarchy began already to be felt. The superior
Junta at Solsona were left to learn as they could
the resolution that had been taken of withdrawing
the army which they had raised and
provided; and deserters were already collecting
in bands and acting as guerrillas, or as banditti, as opportunity
invited. But the Junta, when they laid their
situation (dissembling nothing) before the British admiral,
assured him that they would persevere in the
contest, because they knew that the Catalans were more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
than ever unanimous in their abhorrence of the invaders.
Tarragona had been betrayed, not conquered: the
enemy might congratulate themselves upon their good
fortune, not upon victories well contested and fairly won;
... this was the language of the people. At this crisis,
General Luis Lacy arrived upon the coast to take the
command: the Duque del Infantado had been talked of
for it, and the Catalans wished for him; but the Duke
was more in his place at Cadiz; and a fitter commander
than Lacy could not at that time have been sent to a
charge which might seem so hopeless. Eroles, after a
fruitless endeavour to meet him, sent him full information
of the state of affairs, and promised to support him in the
command whereto he was regularly appointed with all the
personal exertions of which he was capable, and all the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 9.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

influence that he possessed in this his native
province. The French were just then endeavouring
to cut off the Valencian division, and their
movements made the communication difficult between
the army and the coast. The remainder of that division,
however (reduced to 2400, though not a man had fallen,
for they had never faced the enemy), made their way to
Arens de Mar, and were there embarked, Eroles detaining
the enemy by a feint at Mataro. Lacy then assumed
the command of an army which he said was non-existent:
“Bad as I expected to find things,” said he, “they
are infinitely worse; and my only consolation must be,
that there is absolutely nothing left for me to lose.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Montserrate taken by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The fortified points which the Catalans still retained
were Berga, Montserrate (for this had been
made a military post), Figueras, Cardona, and
the Seu d’Urgel. Berga was dismantled by
Lacy, because he was unable to defend it, and it might
have been a useful hold for the French. Orders arrived
from Paris to demolish Tarragona, preserving only a
redoubt there, to reduce Montserrate, and then prepare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
to march against the kingdom of Valencia. Suchet was
at the same time created a marshal of the empire for his
services; the massacre at Tarragona was considered as
no reproach to him, or the army by which it had been
perpetrated. By General Rogniat’s advice, the works
which surrounded the upper town were preserved, because
they might be defended by a thousand men: the
other works were destroyed, and the greater part of the
artillery removed to Tortosa. Montserrate was then
attacked; ... its former peaceful inhabitants had removed
to Majorca, and taken with them in time the treasures
of their sanctuary. Great enterprise and activity were
displayed in the attack; and the garrison, confiding too
much in the natural strength of the mountain, suffered
themselves to be surprised from its heights. This was
a severe loss to the Catalans; for it was now their chief
depôt, and they had counted upon its security. The

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fall of Figueras.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

last calamity in this series of misfortunes was
the fall of Figueras. When it had been blockaded
between four and five months, and all the horses
were eaten, the garrison sallied, and attempted to force
their way through the besiegers. An aid-de-camp of
the governor had deserted and given information of their
purpose; the enemy therefore were prepared to receive
them; nevertheless they made their way to the <i>abattis</i>,
formed of trunks of trees, which they found impenetrable;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 19.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and after three attempts in the course of
one day, these gallant men were compelled to
capitulate, three sacks of flour being all the provisions
which were left. During two preceding days they had
employed themselves in destroying whatever could be of
use to the enemy. Honourable terms were obtained,
and Martinez was made to say in his dispatch to his
own Government that the garrison were treated by the
French with the generosity which characterises that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
nation. That phrase would be rightly understood by

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Base usage of the prisoners taken there.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the Spaniards. It had been stipulated that
they should march out with their baggage, and
deliver their arms on the glacis. But no sooner
had they given up their arms than they were plundered;
and they were marched into France in such a state of
destitution, that they were indebted for needful covering
to the humanity of the towns through which they passed.
Eight hundred peasants were among these prisoners.
Buonaparte sent them to the hulks at Brest and Rochefort,
and there they were compelled to work with the
convicts, being distinguished from them only by a dress
of different colour, not by any difference in<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> treatment.</p>

<p>When Figueras had been recovered from the enemy,
it was asserted in the Government gazette, that in consequence
of that event the French had abandoned Hostalrich
and Gerona, and that the English had taken
Rosas; so readily did the Spaniards listen even to the
idlest rumours of success! The French in like manner
believing, or professing to believe, what they wished,
gave out upon their recapture of this fortress that the
war in Catalonia was ended: so M. Macdonald affirmed
in his dispatches; and the vain boast was repeated in
the Barcelonan journal, though in that city undeniable
proofs of its falsehoods were daily and hourly received.
One of the most remarkable men whom these troubles
had drawn from obscurity into active life was Jose

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Manso.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Manso, who at the commencement of the struggle
followed the humble occupation of a miller
upon a small patrimony of his own, near Barcelona;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
some French officers, by their outrageous conduct towards
him, roused in him a spirit which under happier
circumstances might never have been awakened, and he
began his honourable warfare against the invaders with
only three comrades. By a series of exploits skilfully
planned and bravely executed, he had gained for himself
a high reputation, which was in no slight degree
enhanced by his moral worth; for it might truly be said
of him that he was without fear and without reproach.
When Manso entered upon this new course of life he
was about two or three and twenty years of age, and
was so uneducated that he could neither write nor read;
but every portion of time that could now be spared from
his military duties was devoted to self-improvement, and
his progress in this kept full pace with his fortune. At
this time he held the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the
Catalan army; and when Suchet, soon after the fall of
Tarragona, was on his way to the capital of the province,
he, at the head of a detachment, harassed his march,
and succeeded in cutting off some fifty of the enemy
and taking six, between Ordal and Molins de Rey; but
twelve of his soldiers were taken in these skirmishes,
and the French commander ordered some of them to be
shot, some to be hanged, and some to be burnt, though
they claimed the protection to which they were entitled
by the laws of war, and though they threw themselves
at his feet and entreated mercy. His orders were executed;
some thirty peasants of St. Vincente, Molins de
Rey, and Palleja, who were working in the fields, were
murdered in like manner; and every woman who fell
into the hands of these inhuman troops became their
victim. Manso issued a proclamation denouncing these
crimes before God and man; and declaring that the
right of reprisals which till then he had from humanity
forborne to exercise should instantly be enforced; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
hung his six prisoners in the immediate vicinity of Barcelona;
and gave notice, that every Frenchman who
from that hour fell into his hands should be put to
death, till the enemy should have learnt to treat as prisoners
of war brave men who were fighting for their
country, which had been perfidiously invaded, their religion,
which was insolently outraged, and their king, who
had been treacherously decoyed into captivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conduct of the Junta of Catalonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French asserted also in their journals, that the
Junta of Catalonia had fled to Majorca, giving
up the principality in despair. The Spanish
frigates had indeed run for that island, contrary
to orders, carrying with them the archives, and the
money, stores, ammunition, and medicines intended for
the inland fortresses, and at that time especially needed
by them. But the Junta were at their post when Catalonia
was left to stand or fall by its own strength, and
when without their presence there could have been none
to call forth or direct it. In many parts of Spain the
provincial Juntas disregarded sometimes, and sometimes
counteracted, the orders of the Government; but here
the duties of Government devolved upon the Junta.
From Solsona they now issued some of those proclamations
which contributed so greatly to support the national
cause, calling upon their countrymen in the language of
hope and heroism and indignation, and exhorting them
to rely upon their good cause and their own right arms,
and the justice of the Almighty. The Barcelonan journal
said that Lacy had fled with the Junta. If they
who made this assertion believed it themselves, they

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lacy’s proclamation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

were speedily undeceived. That general declared
in a proclamation, that if his well-founded
hope of soon seeing better days should be disappointed,
he would die with the last soldier rather than abandon
his post: eight days he allowed the dispersed troops for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
rejoining their colours at the places fixed upon; those
who should not then have rejoined were to be pursued
as deserters by the civil and military authorities. “Catalans,”
said he, “the country is in danger, and now
more than ever stands in need of your exertions. The
Junta and your general are bound to explain to you
your situation, because true courage consists not in being
ignorant of danger, but in overcoming it. The fall of
Tarragona has made that situation critical in the extreme,
not desperate. There yet remain to us inextinguishable
hatred of oppression and ardent love of
independence; ... there yet remain to us strong-holds and
mountains; ... there remain to us the arms of our numerous
and valiant youth for recovering what is lost, and
for making the enemy know that the attempt to conquer
us is vain. With fewer resources did Pelayo from the
mountains of Covadonga begin the deliverance of Spain:
and there are not wanting to us chiefs who are determined
to follow his glorious example. Great efforts are
necessary: let our efforts then be united, and for those
who have not spirit to follow this resolution, let them
abandon us and join the enemy, that we may know
whom to treat as enemies, and whom as friends. The
priest, the religioner, the father of a family, every one
has wrongs to avenge, every one has much to lose, and
our country calls upon all. In all parts the alarm-bell is
heard, and wherever there are enemies, there should be
Catalans to fight them. War and vengeance must be
our only business; and, like our forefathers, let us leave
to the women the care of our houses and families!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat of the cavalry from Catalonia to Murcia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Yet while Lacy held this language, and used at the
same time every exertion for collecting the dispersed
troops, he was obliged to dismiss a body
of cavalry, from utter inability to support them,
or even to feed the horses. Brigadier D. Gervasio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Gasca commanded this division, which contained
twelve superior and 112 subaltern officers, 922 men, and
about 500 horses, the remains of the regiment of Alcantara,
the Numancian dragoons, Spanish hussars, <i>cazadores</i>
of Valencia, and hussars of Granada. They had
to make their way through Aragon, into a free province,
and incorporate themselves with the first army they
could find. The details of their march show the skill
with which the enemy had chosen his positions, so as to
give him military command of the country; for near as
Valencia was, Gasca was six weeks on the way, and
travelled between 700 and 800 miles before he could
effect his junction with a Spanish army. He began this
perilous retreat on the 25th of July, with his horses in
miserable condition for want of food, and without money;
getting provisions and information as he could find them;
and having no means of procuring either, except such as
chance or charity might bestow. At Graus, a small
party of the enemy were found, whom they kept in check
with a part of their force, while the rest forded the
Esera by Barazona. Making long marches, so as to
outrun the intelligence of the enemy, they succeeded in
passing the rivers Cinca and Gallego without opposition;
but when they were in the district of Las Cinco
Villas de Aragon, knowing that the French from Barbastro
and Huesca were about to collect and cut them
off, they made yet longer marches, taking a more devious
direction, and moving by night. Notwithstanding these
precautions, they were attacked at midnight near the
village of Luesia, by what force they knew not, but the
fire came from the village, and from a height which
commanded the ground over which they were passing.
Gasca could not prevent his men from making a precipitate
retreat; he had only time to name a place of rendezvous;
and while the enemy, who consisted of 1000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
foot, and from two to three hundred horse, under the
Polish general Chlopiski, hastened to cut them off from
the pass of the Gallego, Gasca avoided them by entering
Navarre, where he rested three days at Eybar, expecting
help from Espoz y Mina to effect the perilous passage of
the Ebro. Three parties of that distinguished leader’s
cavalry came to assist and guide him: their knowledge
of the country was of essential service; they made a
rapid and unexpected march to one of the fords of the
river; its waters were swoln, and they were obliged in
some places to swim: the passage, however, was effected,
and immediately Gasca marched from four in the afternoon
of one day till eight on the following morning, that
he might get out of reach of the garrisons of Tafalla,
Caparroso, and Tudela. The danger was now less imminent,
though still sufficiently great; they made shorter
marches, varying their direction, according to the intelligence
they procured of the enemy; and thus, after six
weeks of such hardships as few people, except the Spaniards,
could have sustained, they joined the army in
Murcia by the circuitous way of Guadalaxara and
Cuenca, having lost upon the road four officers, 153
men, and 213 horses: the greater part of these men
had been dispersed in the night route at Luesia; the
horses had mostly died upon the march.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of the enemy in Catalonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But the Catalans, in circumstances under which almost
any other people would have despaired,
never lost hope; their saying was, that now,
when the fortified places were lost, the war was
only begun. And indeed, deplorable as the state of
things was for the natives, it was far more so for the
invaders: they were masters of almost every fortress,
but their dominion did not extend beyond the walls.
They levied contributions upon the villages near, and
this was all; ... they could only move in large detachments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
and wherever they moved they were harassed by
the armed peasantry and the Somatenes. The daily and
hourly cost of life at which they kept their ground was
such, that the enemy, who avowed their determination
of extirpating half the inhabitants in order to intimidate
the rest, must have exhausted the resources, if not the
patience, of France, before such a determination could
be executed. In the preceding year Suchet had dispersed
a proclamation, declaring that Great Britain and
her Spanish allies had made peace with France, and
acknowledged Joseph Buonaparte as king of Spain. The
French now circulated a report that negotiations were
going on, and with such probability of success, that
Talleyrand had been sent to London, and the Emperor
himself had gone to the coast for the purpose of expediting
the business. But these artifices availed them
nothing, for Doyle contradicted their falsehood in addresses
which were carried everywhere, and eagerly received,
... and British ships were still upon the coast, to
act wherever opportunity might offer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Las Medas recovered by the Spaniards.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Every success at this time was of great importance
in its moral effect. Men are usually alive to
hope in proportion as their natures are generous;
and the same cause, which throughout
the war rendered it impossible to depress the Spaniards,
made them easily elated. Of the patriotic journals
which were published in every part of Spain, scarcely a
number appeared that did not contain details of some
skirmish, some guerrilla attack, some successful enterprise,
or hair-breadth escape, ... more animating than
success in the recital. These things, more even than
signal victories, tended to excite a military spirit, when
no other advantage accrued from them. But of the
advantages which the Catalans at this time obtained,
one was of considerable importance. An expedition of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
Spaniards and English, who in all were but a handful

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 1.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of men, recovered the isles of Las Medas, which
had been betrayed to the enemy the preceding
year. Colonel Green, the British commissioner, and
Baron de Eroles, commanded in this well-planned and
well-executed attempt; and the crew of the Undaunted
frigate, Captain Thomas, displayed that zeal and those
resources in dragging guns up the rocks, by which
British seamen have often made themselves dreaded
upon their enemies’ shores. They found in the fort
four guns and provisions for three months. Both officers
perceived how important it was to retain possession of a
place which at little expense might be rendered a second
Gibraltar, ... for little was necessary to render it impregnable:
here was a post where they could receive supplies,
and here a depôt might be securely established.
Eroles, therefore, dispatched orders for 500 men to
come and garrison it. The French were equally aware
of the advantage which the possession of this point
would give their enemies. They brought down a considerable
force to Estardit, a village on the opposite
shore, and opened batteries against the island, which
was within reach of shells. The succours which Eroles
had gone to expedite did not appear; the force upon
the island consisted only of 146 men, exhausted with
the fatigues they had undergone; and Colonel Green
reluctantly yielding to the representations of the officer

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the Undaunted, abandoned the works which
he had begun, and with them the hopes which
he had formed, and blew up the fort. The opportunity,
however, was happily retrieved. Lacy, who felt the
want of such a point to look to, embarked with 200
men from Arens de Mar in the Undaunted; and taking

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 13.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with him labourers, tools, and stores in some
transports, re-occupied the islands, giving them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
the names of the Isles of Restoration, because, he said,
this might be considered as the first step to the recovery
of the principality. Water was discovered there, a sufficient
garrison established, and the fortifications commenced
and carried on in sight of the enemy on the
opposite shore, and in defiance of their batteries. Bomb-proofs
for men and stores were soon made in a situation
favourable for such works. The chief battery was
named Lacy by the governor; but that general said he
would not permit himself to receive this honour, it
should be called Montardit, in honour of the last Catalan
whom the French, having taken in arms, had put
to death, in violation of the laws of war.</p>

<p>General Lacy, being unable to undertake any considerable
attempt against the enemy, determined, in the
right spirit of a soldier, to make activity and enterprise
supply the want of numbers, and cut up the invaders in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Successful enterprise of Lacy and Eroles.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

detail. They had formed a chain of fortified
posts from Barcelona to Lerida. These he resolved
to attack, and began by a rapid march
upon Igualada, where the enemy had fortified a Capuchine
convent. Four hundred men with two guns were
to have joined him from Cardona; but he was disappointed
of this aid, for no means of moving the guns,
nor for making the road practicable for them, could be
procured in time; all that could be done was to surprise
the town, and cut off as many of the French as possible
before they could take refuge in their fort. At three in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the morning the sentinels were put to the sword,
the enemy surprised in their quarters, twenty-five
prisoners were taken, and about 150 killed; the rest
escaped into the convent, as they got out of their beds;
and Lacy, seeing at daybreak that succours were coming
to them from Monserrate and Casa-Masana, retired to
Col de Gusem, satisfied with his success, and thence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Manresa. This made them suppose that he had desisted
from offensive operations; and a convoy which, in fear
of his movements, had been for some days detained at
Cervera, ventured to move toward Igualada. Eroles
with half the Catalan force got before it, and the commander-in-chief
with the other half cut off its retreat.
A column with artillery sallied from Igualada to its
assistance, but came only to share in the defeat;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 7.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

200 were wounded and made prisoners, the
killed were in proportion, and the whole convoy was
taken.</p>

<p>The general finding now that his presence was necessary
in the Junta, to forward the formation and organization
of the army, left Eroles, his second in command,
to complete the plan, which had already so far succeeded
that the French, dreading a second attack, and
weakened by this last loss, retired precipitately from
Igualada, Monserrate, and Casa-Masana, to Barcelona.
Eroles no sooner knew that Igualada had been evacuated

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 10.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

than he marched against Cervera. The
French, when they saw him approaching, withdrew
from the city into the university, which they had
fortified; and a body of 500 foot and thirty horse,
which had just arrived from Lerida to their support,
turned back to provide for its own safety. D. Luis de
Creeft and D. Jose Casas were sent to pursue them,
while Eroles with one ten-pounder prepared to attack
buildings which had been designed by their founders for
far other purposes than those of war. This single gun
threw down part of the house in which it was planted;
but Eroles turned the accident to advantage; for while
he affected to be replacing it, in order to deceive the
enemy, the gun was moved to another situation, from
whence it opened its fire, anew, and its carriage was
rattled along so as to make them believe that more artillery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
was about to be brought to bear. Their commandant
soon hung out the white flag, and 630 men
were made prisoners of war, at an expense to the Catalans
of only ten in killed and wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Corregidor of Cervera taken and punished.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This conquest set free a considerable territory, which,
ever since the loss of Tarragona, had been at
the enemy’s mercy. Creeft, meantime, with a
force inferior to that he was pursuing, followed
the column which was retreating to Lerida, and which
on its way was joined by the garrison of Tarrega, another
post abandoned by the French in their alarm. In
this pursuit the corregidor of Cervera was taken attempting
to escape with the enemy; a man who had joined
the French, and, with the malevolence of a traitor, persecuted
his own countrymen. He had invented a cage
in which to imprison those who did not pay their contributions,
or were in any way obnoxious to him: it was
so constructed as to confine the whole body, leaving
the head exposed to be buffeted and spit upon; and
sometimes this devilish villain anointed the face of his
victim with honey to attract the flies and wasps. “Tomorrow,”
said Eroles in his dispatches, “the señor corregidor
will go out to parade the streets in this same cage,
where the persons who have suffered this grievous torment
may behold him: <i>Discite justitiam moniti, et non
temnere Divos!</i>” The capture of this man was worth
as much, in the feelings of the people, as all the preceding
success.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Eroles enters France and levies contributions.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Eroles, with the rest of his division, now hastened to
Bellpuig, where Creeft had blockaded about
400 French in the old palace of the Dukes of
Sesa, a castle of the fifteenth century, which
they had fortified, and which commanded the
town. The besiegers had only one ten-pounder, and the
walls were more than seven feet thick. They had no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
time to lose, for Latour, with the troops who had escaped
from Igualada, and the garrisons of the other
evacuated posts, was preparing, in concert with the
enemies from Lerida and Balaguer, to march against
them. Unused as they were to such operations, and, as
Eroles said, without any other engineers than ingenuity
and strong desire, they made three mines which reduced

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the castle almost to a heap of ruins: 184 prisoners
were taken, the rest of the garrison
perished. This success completed Lacy’s plan, and set
free the whole of the country between Lerida and
Barcelona. Eroles then, by a movement as judicious as
it was unexpected, while the French commanders were
concerting plans against him, marched by the Seu de
Urgel to Puigcerda, where he routed all the force that
the enemy could bring against him: then having occupied
the pass of the Valle de Luerol, he entered France,
and levied contributions in Languedoc. It was the earnest
wish of Baron de Eroles that his troops in this expedition
should be as much distinguished by their good
order, moderation, and humanity, as the French in
Spain were for their crimes. In every place, except
one, this object was effected; but in the little town of
Marens, the only place where resistance was made by
the inhabitants and an armed force, a soldier, in violation
of his orders, set fire to one of the houses: the wind was
high, the flames spread, notwithstanding the efforts
which were made to stop them, and the whole place was
burnt. Villamil, governor of Seu de Urgel, who commanded
this division of Eroles’ army, expressed his
regret for what had happened; “<em>But</em>, perhaps,” he
said, “the furious hand which committed the evil had
been impelled by divine justice, that France might behold
an image of Manresa.” Every where else the
orders of the commander were rigidly observed; and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
French, admiring the humanity of an enemy who had
been so grievously wronged, in many places where they
paid the required contribution, acknowledged the justice
of this retaliation. Some thousand sheep and corn,
and specie to the amount of 50,000 dollars, were the
fruits of this first inroad of the Spaniards into France.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">At</span> no time had Lord Wellington’s situation been more
uneasy than at this: not so much because of the
inadequacy of his means in the field, for, such
as they were, he was able to oppose the enemy
and baffle him at all points; as because of the distressed
state of the Portugueze Government, and the apprehended
instability of his own. Marlborough had had
more various and conflicting interests to adjust and
keep in unison, but he had no other difficulty with his
allies: he could rely upon a sure support in the British
cabinet, till he had beaten down all opposition in the
field; and the feelings both of the army and the nation
were with him. Lord Wellington might rely upon
himself with a confidence as well founded, but he could
have no other trust. Nothing was to be expected from
any government which the Spaniards might form for
themselves; and it now began to appear that the inert
part of the nation, which must every where be the
majority, would have been best pleased to remain neuter
if that had been possible, and let the French and
English fight the battle and bear the cost. Portugal,
indeed, had been delivered from the enemy: but there
Lord Wellington had to contend with intrigues and
jealousies in the Government both at Lisbon and Rio de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
Janeiro; and with the difficulties arising from want of
provisions, want of transports, and the state of the
commissariat, the persons employed in which were for
the most part either idle or dishonest, or ignorant of their
duty; so that at this time the Portugueze army, though
brought by Marshal Beresford and the British officers to
an efficient state of discipline, was reduced to half its
nominal strength. Their troops were starving in the
field, and dying in the hospitals, for want of money. If
there was much to complain of here on the part of the
Portugueze ministry, the conduct of Great Britain itself
was neither consistent nor generous. Engaged as we
were in the war, Lord Wellington thought we ought to
have entered upon it with a determination of carrying
Portugal through it at whatever cost; that for this
purpose we should have required an efficient control
over all the departments of the state, have seen the
resources of the country honestly and exclusively applied
to the objects of the war, and have made up the deficiency
whatever it might be: this he had recommended
from the beginning, but the influence which was exercised
was less at this time than it had been when the
Convention of Cintra was concluded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Expectation of peace.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>No general ever more anxiously desired to be placed
at the head of an army than Lord Wellington
did now to be relieved from the command; but
of this he had no prospect, except from such a
peace as would in its certain consequences have given
Buonaparte all that he was seeking vainly to obtain by
war. There was great apparent danger of this at this
time. In case of the death of the king, or the acknowledged
unlikelihood of his recovery (which now daily
became more unlikely), the French speculated upon a
change of administration in England, and the accession
of the Whigs to power. The French officers eagerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
looked for this, expecting to make such a peace as would
enable them to withdraw from the Peninsula without
loss of credit, and to re-enter it as soon as their perfidious
policy should have prepared a favourable opportunity.
In our own army also there were many who
regarded the probability of peace with as much complacency
as if the end for which the war had been
waged would have been secured by it. These were
persons who neither by their acquirements, nor pitch of
mind, were qualified for the rank which they had
attained in their profession; who had not the slightest
feeling or perception of the great interests which were
at stake, but knowing little, understanding nothing, and
criticising every thing, infected all about them with
despondency and discontent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Disposition of the continental powers to resist Buonaparte.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the other hand, there was at this time, in many
parts of Europe, hopeful symptoms, of which
Lord Wellington was well informed. Even
when Austria had concluded the most unfortunate
of its struggles, with loss of honour as
well as loss of territory, one of the wisest heads
in Germany assured the British Government, that
although the German courts swarmed with men who
were great calculators of all possible disasters, and who
knew nothing more of the human heart than its weaknesses
and its selfishness, ... the Germans themselves,
though subjugated, were not yet debased by their subjugation;
they would one day revenge their wrongs; a
warlike spirit would be developed among them, which
had been neglected or suppressed by their feeble and
corrupt governments; and it would then be seen that
there are times when enthusiasm judges more wisely
than experience, and when elevation of mind creates resources
for the talents which it calls forth. Russia,
which had so long been duped by Buonaparte, became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
sensible of his perfidy, when, in violation of the treaty of
Tilsit, he incorporated the Hanse towns and the duchy
of Oldenburgh with the French empire. An opposition
to the tyrant’s schemes was manifested in Sweden,
where it was less to have been expected: for when the
French government demanded permission to march troops
through Sweden into Norway, and embark them there
for the purpose of invading England, the Swedish
government refused, and communicated its refusal to
the British cabinet. Prussia, meantime, was silently
preparing to break its yoke; and in the course of this
autumn, arms, stores, and artillery to a considerable
amount, were shipped from England for its use. This
was so secretly done, that not a rumour got abroad of
any expectations from that quarter; and if the British
ministry had acted with as much ability in the management
of the war, as in its other foreign relations, its
conduct would now have been entitled to unqualified
praise: but no representations could as yet induce it to
make exertions proportionate to the opportunities that
invited, or the necessity that called for them. Whether
Buonaparte apprehended, or not, any opposition to his
ambitious career in the north of Europe, he was too able
a politician to let pass the opportunity of employing as
large a force in the Peninsula as could be supported
there upon his predatory system of warfare; and accordingly
more than 50,000 troops were marched into
Spain between the middle of July and the end of September.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Plans of Soult and Marmont.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When Marmont and Soult, finding it impossible to
take Lord Wellington at advantage, separated
on the Guadiana, their plan was, that the former
should keep the English in check, while Dorsenne,
who had succeeded Bessieres in the north, should
enter Galicia, fortify Lugo, seize Coruña by a <i>coup de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
main</i>, and in this manner once more obtain military possession
of the province.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dorsenne enters Galicia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Abadia had just taken the command of the Galician
army; it was in wretched equipment, and without
magazines of any kind; but the men had
confidence in their general, and when Spanish
soldiers have this feeling to invigorate them, they will
support privations under which the troops of almost any
other nation would sink. His advanced guard was at
S. Martin de los Torres, and occupied the bridge of
Cebrones; one division was at Bañeza, another at the
bridge of Orbigo, and the reserve at Astorga. Dorsenne
collected his troops in a line of operations on the
Ezla, the right leaning upon Leon, and the left at Castro

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Gonzalo: then he crossed the Ezla, one division
marching upon the bridge of Orbigo, two upon
Bañeza, and the reserve upon Cebrones. Abadia well
knowing the state of his own army, and the strength of
the country behind him, had formed his plans in case of
such an attack. The division at Bañeza withstood a
charge of lancers, and fell back in good order to Castro
Contrigo, from whence its retreat was unmolested to
Puebla de Sanabria, the place appointed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat of Abadia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The other divisions fell back from four in the evening,
when the enemy first presented themselves, till
night had closed, when they were all collected
in Castrillo. The next day the French entered upon the
mountains behind Astorga in pursuit. The points of
Manzanal and Molina Seca were well defended, and
though the Spaniards retired at both points before superior
numbers, they brought off with them the eagle of
the sixth regiment of infantry, which Abadia, in the
name of the army, dedicated to Santiago, and deposited
in the chapel of that saint, in his cathedral at Compostella.
Seeing the force of the enemy, and divining their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
purpose, he fell back to Ponferrada, covering, with his
little cavalry, a considerable body of men who were
crippled for want of shoes, and in the most dismal state
of nakedness and want. The ferry in Valdeorras, that
gorge through which the river Sil entering Galicia carries
with it all the waters of the Bierzo, was the point of
re-union. The artillery at Villafranca was ordered back
into the interior, three regiments took a position upon
the heights of Valcarcel to cover the roads from that
town, and another detachment was stationed at Toreno
for the double purpose of assisting the reserve and
watching Asturias. Abadia himself took a position at
the Puente de Domingo Florez. In the Vale of Orras
he hoped to find provisions, meaning, as soon as he
should have collected enough for three days, and received
shoes for his men, to act upon the offensive, in
co-operation with the Portugueze general Silveira.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Wellington observes Ciudad Rodrigo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French hoped, that while Dorsenne was dispersing
the Galician army, and getting possession
of that important province, Lord Wellington
would make some incautious movement upon
Salamanca, and expose himself to Marmont’s
superior numbers, and far superior cavalry, in the open
country. Lord Wellington knew better in what manner
to relieve Galicia. Immediately upon his failure at
Badajoz, his attention had been directed to Ciudad
Rodrigo, and orders were given for bringing a battering
train and siege stores up the Douro to Villa de Ponte,
whereby much of the difficulty experienced in Alentejo
for want of means of transport was avoided. General
Hill had been left with 14,000 men to guard that frontier;
the rest of the army was collected on the Agueda;
and Lord Wellington fixing his head-quarters at Fuente
Guinaldo, kept his troops there in a healthy country,
and rendered it impossible for the enemy to throw supplies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
into Ciudad Rodrigo, unless they advanced with
an army strong enough to give him battle. Marmont,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dorsenne recalled from Galicia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

in consequence, recalled Dorsenne to join him,
that they might raise the blockade, and supply
the fort with provisions for a long time. Dorsenne,
indeed, could not have advanced without danger
of having his retreat cut off; even in his own account,
wherein he asserted that the Galician army was entirely
dispersed, and could not possibly resume the offensive,
he pretended to have occasioned them no greater loss
than that of 300 killed and wounded, and 200 prisoners:
but in reality no dispersion had taken place: if he had
pursued his original plan of descending upon Lugo and
Coruña, Abadia would have been in his rear, and the
French knew by experience what it was to encounter
the peasantry of Galicia, armed against them, and thirsting
for vengeance. Dorsenne therefore retired more
rapidly than he had advanced, leaving behind him some
of his wounded, and provisions enough to supply Abadia’s
army with three days’ consumption, ... a booty of no little
consequence in the deplorable state of the Spanish commissariat.
The Spaniards in their turn advanced, and
fixed their head-quarters in Molina Seca, where

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 31.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

they had won the eagle four days before; and
the French derived no other advantage from their expedition,
than the possession of Astorga, which they once
more occupied, and repaired its ruined fortifications.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements of the French to throw supplies into Ciudad Rodrigo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The relief of Ciudad Rodrigo was an object not less
important to the French in this part of the
country than that of Badajoz had been on the
side of Extremadura, and equal exertions were
made to effect it. Lord Wellington had formed
the blockade to make these exertions necessary,
not with any serious intention of attacking the town, an
operation for which he was not yet prepared. Two important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
objects were fulfilled by making the enemy collect
their force upon this point. It relieved Galicia,
and it drew from Navarre General Souham’s division,
which had been destined to hunt down Mina. Lord
Wellington was perfectly informed of Marmont’s plans;
the only thing doubtful was the strength of the enemy,
and upon that head reports were as usual so various,
that he determined to see them, being certain of his retreat,
whatever their superiority might be, and ready to
profit by any opportunity which might be offered. As
soon, therefore, as the French commenced their movements
with the convoy of provisions from the Sierra de
Bejar, and from Salamanca, he collected his army in
positions from which he could either retire or

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 22.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

advance without difficulty, and from whence he
could see all that was going on, and ascertain the force
of the hostile army.</p>

<p>The third division occupied a range of heights on the
left of the Agueda, between Fuente Guinaldo and Pastores,
having its advanced guard on the heights of Pastores,
within three miles of Ciudad Rodrigo. The
fourth division was at Fuente Guinaldo, which position
had been strengthened with some works. The light
division was on the right of the Agueda, its right resting
upon the mountains which divide Castille and Extremadura.
The left, under General Graham, who, having
joined Lord Wellington’s army, had succeeded Sir Brent
Spencer as second in command, was posted on the Lower
Azava; D. Carlos d’España and D. Julian Sanchez observed
the Lower Agueda, and Sir Stapleton Cotton,
with the cavalry, was on the Upper Azava in the centre.
The fifth division was in the rear of the right, to observe
the Pass of Perales, for General Foy had collected a
body of troops in Upper Extremadura. On the 23rd,
the enemy appeared in the plain near the city, and retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
again: the next morning they advanced in considerable
force, and before evening collected on the
plain their whole cavalry, to the amount of 6000, and
four divisions of infantry; the rest of their army was encamped
on the Guadapero, immediately beyond the
hills which surround the plain; and on the following
day an immense convoy, extending along many miles of
road, entered the town under this formidable escort.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The allies fall back.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 25th, fourteen squadrons of their cavalry drove
in our posts on the right of the Azava. General
Anson’s brigade charged them, pursued them
across the river, and resumed the posts. But their chief
attention was directed toward the heights on the left of
the Agueda; and they moved a column in the morning,
consisting of between thirty and forty squadrons of
cavalry, fourteen battalions of infantry, and twelve guns,
from Ciudad Rodrigo, against that point. The cavalry
and artillery arrived first, and one small body sustained
the attack. A regiment of French dragoons succeeded
in taking two pieces of cannon; the Portugueze artillerymen
stood to their guns till they were cut down; and
the guns were immediately retaken by the second battalion
of the fifth regiment under Major Ridge. When
the enemy’s infantry were coming up, Lord Wellington
saw they would arrive before troops could be brought to
support this division, and therefore he determined to
retire with the whole on Fuente Guinaldo. The 77th,
which had repulsed a charge of cavalry, and the second
battalion of the 5th, were formed into one square, and
the 21st Portugueze regiment into another, supported by
General Alten’s small body of cavalry, and by the Portugueze
artillery. The enemy’s horse immediately
rushed forward, and obliged our cavalry to retire to the
support of the Portugueze regiment. The 5th and 77th
were then charged on three faces of the square; Lord<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
Wellington declared, that he had never seen a more
determined attack than was made by this formidable
body of horse, and repulsed by these two weak battalions.
They halted, and received the enemy with
such perfect steadiness, that the French did not venture
to renew the charge.</p>

<p>In the evening, Lord Wellington had formed his
troops into an <i>echellon</i>, of which the centre was in the
position at Guinaldo, the right upon the pass of Perales,
and the left at Navedeaver. In the course of that night
and of the ensuing day, Marmont brought his whole
army in front of the position. Fuente Guinaldo stands
on an extensive plain, and from the convent there the
whole force of the enemy, and all their movements,
could be distinctly seen. Their force was not less than
60,000 men, a tenth part being cavalry, and they had
125 pieces of artillery. There was no motive for risking
a battle, for the happiest result would only have been a
profitless and dearly-purchased victory, as at Albuhera.
Lord Wellington therefore retired about three leagues.
No movement was ever executed with more ability in
the face of a superior enemy; ... yet even this, performed
with consummate skill and perfect courage, without
hurry, without confusion, and almost without loss, presented
but too many of those sights which make the
misery of a soldier’s life. The sick and hungry inhabitants
of the villages were crawling from their huts, too
well aware of the fate which awaited them if they
trusted to the mercy of Buonaparte’s soldiers; women
were supplicating our troops to put their children in the
provision cars; and the sick and wounded were receiving
medical assistance, while they were carried over
a rugged and almost impassable road.</p>

<p>Lord Wellington formed his army, after this retreat of
twelve miles, with his right at Aldea Velha, and his left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
at Bismula: the fourth and light divisions with General
Alten’s cavalry in front of Alfayates, the third and seventh
in second line behind it. Alfayates, though now
one of the most wretched of the dilapidated towns in
Portugal, was once a Romish station, and has since
been considered as a military post of great importance.
It is about a league from the border, standing so as to
command an extensive view over a beautiful, and in
happier times a fertile, country. Here Lord Wellington
stood by the castle (one of the monuments of King
Diniz), observing the enemy with a glass. Marmont
had intended to turn the left of the position at Guinaldo
by moving a column into the valley of the Upper
Azava, and thence ascending the heights in the rear of
the position by Castillejo; from this column he detached
a division of infantry and fourteen squadrons of cavalry
to follow the retreat of the allies by Albergaria, and
another body of equal strength followed by Forcalhos.
The former drove in our piquets at Aldea da Ponte, and
pushed on to the very entrance of Alfayates. Lord
Wellington, with General Stuart and Lord Robert Manners,
stood watching them almost too long; for the latter,
who retired the last of the three, was closely pursued by
ten of the enemy’s dragoons, and might probably have
been taken, if his horse, being English, and accustomed
to such feats, had not cleared a high wall, and so borne
him off.</p>

<p>General Pakenham, supported by General Cole, and
by Sir Stapleton Cotton’s cavalry, drove the enemy back
through Aldea da Ponte upon Albergaria; the French
being reinforced by the column which had marched
upon Forcalhos advanced again about sunset, and again
gained the village, from which they were again driven.
But night had now come on; General Pakenham could
not know what was passing on his flanks, nor was he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
certain of the numbers which might be brought against
him; and knowing that the army was to fall back farther,
he evacuated Aldea da Ponte during the night.
The French then occupied it; and Lord Wellington,
falling back one league, formed his army on the heights
behind Soito, having the Sierra das Mesas on their right,
and their left at Rendo on the Coa. Here ended his
retreat. Marmont had accomplished the object of throwing
supplies into Ciudad Rodrigo, and could effect nothing
more. Lord Wellington was not to be found at
fault. He had fallen back in the face of a far outnumbering
enemy, without suffering that enemy to obtain
even the slightest advantage over him. The total loss
of the allies on the 25th amounted to twenty-eight
killed, 108 wounded, twenty-eight missing. On the
27th, fourteen killed, seventy-seven wounded, nine missing.
The hereditary prince of Orange was in the field,
being then for the first time in action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French retire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the British took their position behind Soito,
the French retired to Ciudad Rodrigo, and then
separated, Dorsenne’s army toward Salamanca
and Valladolid, Marmont’s towards the pass of Baños
and Plasencia. Marmont boasted in his dispatches of
having forced Lord Wellington to abandon an intrenched
camp, and driven him back with great loss

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marmont boasts of his success.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and confusion; “The Spanish insurgents,” he
added, “have felt the greatest indignation at
seeing themselves thus abandoned in the north
as well as in the south; and this contrast between the
conduct of the English, and the promises which they
have incessantly broken, nourishes a natural hatred,
which will break out sooner or later.” “We should have
followed the enemy,” said Marshal Marmont, “to the
lines of Lisbon, where we should have been able to form
a junction with the army of the south, ... which is completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
entire, and has in its front only the division of
General Hill, ... had the moment been come which is
fixed for the catastrophe of the English.” Soult, of
whose unbroken strength Marmont thus boasted, was
at this time devising measures for destroying the army
which Castaños had recruited, or rather remade, since
it had been so miserably wasted after Romana’s death.
General Girard therefore, with a division of about 4000
foot and 1000 cavalry, was sent into that part of Extremadura
which was still free, thus to confine Castaños
within narrower limits, and deprive his army of those
rations which it still, though with difficulty, obtained, and
which were its sole means of subsistence; for in the
miserable state of the Spanish commissariat and Spanish
Government, their armies subsisted upon what they could
find, and had little or nothing else to depend upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Girard in Extremadura.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Girard took his position at Caceres, extending as far
as Brozas. Of the spirit in which his detachment
acted, one instance will suffice. He sent a
party against the house of D. Jose Maria Cribell
in Salvatierra, an officer in the service of his country;
they carried off his wife in the fifth month of her
pregnancy; plundered the house, even to the clothes of
her two children, one five years old, the other three, and
left these children naked to the mercy of their neighbours.
The presence of such a force greatly distressed
the country, and produced the intended inconvenience
to Castaños; that general, therefore, concerted with
Lord Wellington a movement for relieving this part of
Extremadura by striking a blow against the enemy.
The execution was entrusted to general Hill, with whom
a Spanish detachment was to co-operate under Camp-Marshal
D. Pedro Augustin Giron.</p>

<p>General Hill, with such a portion of his force as was
thought sufficient for the service, moved from his cantonments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
in the neighbourhood of Portalegre on the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Hill moves against him.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

22nd of October, and advanced towards the
Spanish frontier. On reaching Alburquerque
he learned that the enemy, who had advanced
to Aliseda, had fallen back to Arroyo del Puerco; and
that Aliseda was occupied by the Conde de Penne Villemur
with the rear of the Spaniards. At that place, the
allies and the Spaniards formed their junction the next
day. The French occupied Arroyo del Puerco with 300
horse, their main body being at Caceres. Penne Villemur,
on the 25th, drove back their horse to Malpartida,
which place they held as an advanced post. At two on
the following morning the allies began their march upon
this place, in the midst of a severe storm; they arrived
at daybreak; but the enemy had retired in the night.
Penne Villemur, with the Spanish cavalry, and a party
of the second hussars, followed them, skirmishing as
far as Caceres, supported by the Spanish infantry under
D. Pablo Morillo. Girard, as soon as he knew that
the allies were advancing, retired from that city, and
General Hill received intelligence of his retreat at Malpartida,
but what direction he had taken was uncertain.
In consequence of this uncertainty, and of the extreme
badness of the weather, the British and Portugueze
halted for the night at Malpartida, the Spaniards occupying
Caceres.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 27.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The next morning General Hill, having ascertained
that the enemy had marched on Torremocha,
put his troops in motion, and advancing along
the Merida road, by Aldea del Cano, and the Casa de
D. Antonio; for as this was a shorter line than that
which Girard had taken, he hoped to intercept him and
bring him to action. On the march he learned that the
French had only left Torremocha that morning, and that
their main body had again halted at Arroyo Molinos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
leaving a rear-guard at Albala. This proved that Girard
was ignorant of the movements of the allies, and
General Hill therefore made a forced march that evening
to Alcuescar, a place within four miles of Arroyo
Molinos, where he was joined by the Spaniards from
Caceres. Everything confirmed the British general in
his opinion that the enemy were not only ignorant of his
near approach, but also off their guard; and he determined
upon attempting to surprise them, or at least
bringing them to action, before they should march in the
morning. The troops, therefore, lay under a hill, to be
out of sight of the enemy; they had marched the whole
day in a heavy rain, the rain still continued, and no fires
were allowed to be made.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arroyo Molinos.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Arroyo Molinos is a little town situated at the foot of
one extremity of the Sierra de Montanches;
this mountain, which is everywhere steep, and
appears almost inaccessible, forms a cove or crescent
behind it, the two points of which are about two miles
asunder. The Truxillo road winds under the eastern
point; the road to Merida runs at right angles with that
to Alcuescar, and that to Medellin between the Truxillo
and Merida roads. The ground between Alcuescar
and Arroyo Molinos is a plain, thinly scattered with
cork-trees and evergreen oaks; and General Hill’s object
was to place a body of troops so as to cut off the
retreat of the enemy by any of these roads. At two in
the morning, the allies moved from their comfortless
bivouac: it was dark, the rain was unabated, and the
wind high, but in their backs: but this weather, severe
as it was, was in their favour, for it confirmed the
French in their incautious security. When Girard had
first advanced into Extremadura, he felt some uneasiness
at the neighbourhood of General Hill, and demanded
succour, saying, that unless he was reinforced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
he should not be able to resist in case the English
should attack him. But the little enterprise which the
British and Portugueze army had hitherto displayed,
seems to have lulled him into a contemptuous confidence;
and there was no distinguished guerrilla leader
to disturb the enemy in this part of the country, since
D. Ventura Ximenes fell in a rencontre near Toledo.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French surprised and routed there.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The allies moved in one column right in front upon
Arroyo Molinos, till they were within half a
mile of it: the column then closed in a bottom
under cover of a low ridge, and divided into
three, the enemy not having the slightest intimation of
their approach. The left column, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Stuart, marched direct upon the town; the
right, under Major-General Howard, broke off to the
right so as to turn the enemy’s flank, and having
marched about the distance of a cannon-shot toward
that flank, moved then in a circular direction upon the
farther point of the mountain crescent. Penne Villemur,
with the Spanish horse, advanced between these two
columns, ready to act in front, or to move round either of
them, as occasion might require; he had found a good
road, but the English horse, owing to an error, which, in
so dark and tempestuous a night, might easily have been
more general, had gone astray, and were not yet come
up. The French had had a piquet about a mile from
the town, which would have given the alarm, if it had
not retired just before the head of our column came to
the spot; for Girard had ordered the troops to be in
motion at an early hour. One brigade of his infantry
had marched for Medellin an hour before daylight: and
when the allies were close at hand, Girard was filing out
upon the Merida road; the rear of his column, some of
his cavalry and his baggage, being still in the town. A
thick mist had come on, the storm was at its height, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
the French general marched with as little precaution as
if he had been in a friendly country. When he heard that
an enemy was approaching in the mist, he laughed, and
said, “the English were too fond of comfort to get out of
their beds in such a morning; ... it could only be an
advanced party of the Spaniards;” ... but while he was
ordering his men to chastise these insurgents, the Highland
bagpipes played “<i>Hey, Johnny Coup, are ye waukin
yet?</i>” and the 71st and 92d charged into the town
with three cheers. Their orders were not to load, nor
to halt for prisoners; but to force through every obstacle
between them and the enemy, without turning to the
right or left.</p>

<p>A few of their men were cut down by the French
cavalry, but they soon drove the enemy every where
before them at the point of the bayonet. The enemy’s
infantry, which had got out of the town, formed into two
squares, with their cavalry on their left, between the
Merida and Medellin roads, by the time our two regiments
had forced their way to the end of the town.
Their right square being within half musket-shot, the
71st promptly lined the garden walls, while the 92d filed
out and formed in line on the right, perpendicularly to
the enemy’s right flank, which was much annoyed by the
well-directed fire of the 71st. Meantime, one wing of
the 50th occupied the town and secured the prisoners,
some of whom were surprised over their coffee; and the
other wing, with a three-pounder, which was all the
artillery the allies had brought, skirted the outside of
the town, and fired with great effect upon the squares.
General Howard’s column was moving round their left.
Penne Villemur meantime engaged the enemy’s cavalry,
till Sir W. Erskine came up and joined him; they then
presently dispersed the French horse, and charged their
infantry repeatedly, “passing through their lines,” said a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
serjeant, “just like herrings through a net.” The
French were now in full retreat, when, to their utter
dismay, General Howard’s column appeared, and cut off
the road. There was no resource, but to surrender or
disperse; all order was at an end ... the cavalry fled in all
directions, the infantry threw down their arms, and
clambered up the mountain, ... where, inaccessible as the
way appeared, they were pursued by General Howard,
till the British became so exhausted, and so few in number,
that he was obliged to halt and secure his prisoners.
Morillo, with the Spanish infantry, one English and one
Portugueze battalion, having ascended by the Puerto de
las Quebradas, in a more favourable direction, continued
the pursuit farther, and met with more resistance; but
they drove the enemy from every position which they
attempted to take, and pursued them many leagues, till
within sight of the village of St. Anna, when, being
completely exhausted with their exertions, they returned,
having counted in the woods and mountains upwards of
600 dead.</p>

<p>In this brilliant affair, General Brun, the Prince de
Aremberg, two lieutenant colonels, thirty other officers,
and 1400 men, were made prisoners. The British and
Portugueze loss amounted only to seventy-one, that of
the Spaniards was very trifling. The whole of the
enemy’s artillery, baggage, and commissariat was taken,
the magazines of corn which they had collected at
Caceres and Merida, and the contribution of money
which he had levied upon the former town. A panic
was struck into the enemy, to such a degree, that Badajoz
was shut for two days and nights, all the fords of the
Guadiana were watched, and every detachment ordered
to rendezvous at Seville.</p>

<p>This expedition was less important in itself, than as it
was the first indication of a spirit of hopeful enterprise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
in the British army; it seemed as if that army had now
become conscious of its superiority, and would henceforth
seek opportunities of putting it to the proof. For
the Spaniards it was a well-timed success, when all their
own efforts tended only to evince more mournfully the
inefficiency of their troops and the incompetence of their
generals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marques del Palacio appointed to the command in Valencia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Marques del Palacio had been appointed captain-general
of the kingdoms of Aragon, Valencia,
and Murcia. He announced his coming in a
proclamation from Alicante, of a very different
character from those which had so greatly contributed
to support the cause of Spain. “From the
moment,” said he, “that I set foot in this country, and
knew the fall of Tarragona, my spirit, far from being
cast down, seemed as if it had taken fresh courage to run
to danger as well as to victory. Do not hold me arrogant
and vain, for my hopes are not rested upon the arm
of flesh. From afar I see the walls of Valencia of
burnished and impenetrable brass; and the more secure,
inasmuch as the enemy cannot perceive them. I see also
a cloud of protection over the whole kingdom, whereof
that which for forty years protected the people of God
was but a type and a figure. The brazen walls are the
Valencian breasts, which have loyalty for their stamp
and shield of arms; and the cloud which protects us is
the Queen of Angels, ... she who is the general of the
best appointed army, our adorable and generous Madre
de desamparados, <i>Mother of the helpless</i>, with her
omnipotent Son. Heaven itself has given the greatest
proof of this truth, and of its predilection for the city
and kingdom of Valencia. Is there any other capital in
all Spain which has not been entered by some army of
this Corsican robber, this impious tyrant? Is there any
other province which has twice repelled the enemy from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
its centre, without walls and without armies? Heaven
and this invincible Deborah, or Judith, have saved us,
and will save us, if our conduct is not unworthy of her
protection. Wonder not at this language from a soldier!
I am a Christian; I am an old Spaniard; and I am
persuaded that they are not earthly victories, but bolts
from heaven which reach the wicked, such as the
Corsican and his generals, whose principles are bad, and
whose conduct is worse. I resign, therefore, my staff to
this Sovereign Queen: she has been the general who
has delivered the kingdom thus long: she it is who will
deliver all that is placed under this staff, no longer mine
but hers, and the Lord’s, who is the God of battles.”</p>

<p>It would be wronging the Marques to break off here,
for in other parts of his address he spoke in the proper
language of a Spaniard and a general. “This is a holy
war,” said he, “in which we must fight like the Maccabees.
Let him who feels for the public cause join us,
and take arms, and offer himself as a sacrifice, and put
forth his hand, and advance, and attack, and triumph.
Confide in the Government, and it will confide in you.
If there is conduct in the chiefs, there will be conduct
in the people; moderation in the expenditure, and there
will be plenty in the army; order in private families,
and it will display itself in public actions; activity in
individuals, and the army will be invincible. Let there
be obedience, union, fidelity, justice, and truth, and God
will fight with us.”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there were many in Valencia upon
whom the first part of this address was likely to have
more effect than the second. A friar, preaching in the
Plaza Catalina, said to his auditors, “If the Cortes think
of abolishing our holy order, and that of our sisters the
nuns, obey them not, ye armed Valencians, but oppose
such mandates like lions. We are the servants of God,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
whom you must obey rather than man. The English
themselves, though they have an excellent constitution,
must eventually fall for want of the blessing of the Catholic
faith. Ask not for cannon and gunpowder, but
rather fly to your altars; and instead of any vain attempt
to resist the victorious French by force of arms, implore
the aid of Heaven, which alone can avert the heavy
calamities that threaten you.” Zaragoza is as Catholic a
city as Valencia, but it was not by such sermons as this
that the heroism of the Zaragozans was excited and sustained!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Blake takes the command.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Zaragoza had defended itself without any other reliance
than what the inhabitants placed in themselves.
Valencia prepared for its defence under
very different circumstances. The Regent, General
Blake, embarking with all the force he could collect,
had landed at Almeira to take the command in those
provinces, which, since the fall of Tarragona, were so seriously
menaced. From thence he proceeded to Valencia,
with full powers, civil as well as military, and the whole
strength of the executive authority, to carry into effect
whatever measures he might think needful. The collected
force under his command was more than equal in
number to that of the invaders; one division of 6000
men, taking its name from the field of Albuhera, had attained
discipline upon which the officers could rely, and
reputation which every effort would be made to support.
Some of the generals also stood high in public opinion;
Lardizabal had distinguished himself in Lapeña’s expedition;
and Zayas was thought by the English, as well
as by his own countrymen, one of the best officers in the
Spanish service. But Blake himself inspired no confidence
wherever he went; he had the reputation of
being an unfortunate general; and what credit he acquired
in the battle of Albuhera had been lost by his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
subsequent movements in the Condado de Niebla. The
Valencians, therefore, were unwilling to receive him, and
would fain have persuaded the Marques del Palacio to
retain the command, to which, in these times of insubordination,
a popular election would have been considered
as conferring a legitimate right; but the Marques had
been bred in a better school, and though he had some
reason to complain of the manner in which he was thus
suddenly superseded, demeaned himself toward his successor
with a frankness and cordiality deserving a better
return than they obtained. In the course of more than
thirty years’ service, it had been his good fortune never
to incur the slightest disaster in any command which he
had held; twice during the present war, having been
appointed to armies which he found incomplete and ill-equipped,
he had placed them upon a respectable footing;
and being then removed from the command, they
had presently under his successors been dispersed or
destroyed; he was popular, therefore, because no miscarriage
could be laid to his charge. Embarking from
Cadiz for Alicante on the day that Tarragona was taken,
he brought with him no supplies either in men, arms, or
money, nor was any thing sent after him; it seemed as if
the eastern provinces were left to their own resources;
and Alicante and Orihuela, from whence he might have
drawn supplies, were separated from his government.
The Murcian army consisted nominally at this time of
20,000 foot and 5000 horse; he asked for 3000 of these
men and 600 cavalry, and they were refused. The effect
of this was, that feeling he had no external support to
look for, he formed his plans for defence upon the nature
of the country, and that moral resistance, in which the
strength of the Spanish cause consisted: but Blake
coming with the entire confidence of the executive Government,
of which he was a member, had the Murcian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
forces at his command, and seemed to think his military
means so fully sufficient, that he disregarded all other
resources. The Marques would have defended the
strong ground through which the enemy must pass before
they could attack Murviedro. Between that town
and Valencia is a labyrinth of water-courses, gardens,
plantations, and deep narrow roads, through which no
force could penetrate against the resistance of a determined
people; ... and if that resistance had been overcome,
he would have cut the dikes and inundated the
country. These plans he communicated to Blake, who
never bestowed a thought upon them, contemplating no
measures which were not in the ordinary course of tactics,
and thinking, that if the punctilios of his profession
were correctly observed, nothing farther could be required
on the score of honour or of duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Murviedro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Murviedro is an open town twelve miles east of Valencia,
but its fortress, called the Castle of San
Fernando de Sagunto, was, both for its natural
strength and artificial defences, a most formidable post.
D. Luis Maria Andriani commanded there with a garrison
of 3500 men, who had volunteered for its defence.
The name which that fortress bore, and the knowledge of
the resistance which upon that spot had been made against
Hannibal, as it might well have given confidence to
its defenders, induced Suchet to expect greater difficulty
in its conquest than any which he had yet overcome.
The Roman theatre here, which was one of the most
perfect remains of the ancients, and the other antiquities
of this sacred spot, were held in such proper estimation
by the Spanish Government, that in 1785, under the
ministry of the Conde d’Aranda, an officer was appointed
to preserve them. When it was deemed necessary to
fortify the place, the engineers condemned the theatre;
the conservator appealed to the Cortes, and the Cortes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
unanimously agreeing that it would be a reproach to
the nation if this precious monument should be destroyed,
addressed the Regents, requiring them to give orders for
its careful preservation: but such considerations could
no longer be allowed, when the paramount interests of
the nation were at stake, and instructions were given to
make any demolition which might be required for the
security of the place. Andriani entered upon his command
there in the middle of September, and a few days
afterwards the French from Tortosa and from Aragon
began their march toward Valencia. Suchet had with

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suchet takes possession of the town.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

him all the disposable troops from Aragon and
Catalonia, ... withdrawing many of the less important
garrisons and smaller detachments, in
full confidence that there was neither energy enough in
the general Government of Spain, nor union enough
among the provincial authorities, to take advantage of
the opportunity which was thus afforded them. He
arrived before Murviedro on the 21st, and took possession
of the town. Blake, who had advanced thither to
see that the garrison was complete, and the place provided
for defence, offered no resistance when the enemy
approached, but retired within an intrenched camp, on
the right of the Guadalaviar; it rested with its right
upon the sea, and covered the city of Valencia; he had
the Murcian army behind him in reserve. The divisions
of Obispo and Villacampa, under Carlos O’Donnel, had
been recalled from the frontiers of Castille and Aragon:
these remained in the field and formed his left; 4000
men occupied Segorbe and Liria, and Bassecourt, with
about 2000, was in Requeña and Utril: besides these
forces the commander-in-chief had 1600 cavalry, part of
them veteran troops.</p>

<p>Against such means of resistance Suchet would never
have ventured to advance if he had not despised the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
Valencians. With an abundant population, brave and
patriotic enough to offer themselves to any danger and
submit to any sacrifices, ... and with resources greater
than those of any other province from its redundant fertility,
Valencia had scarcely made an effort in favour of
its neighbours. When, at the earnest requisition of the
British naval commander on that coast, a body of its
troops had been detached into Catalonia, they were embarked
without muskets, because there was an established
regulation, that before they left the province
their arms must be deposited in the arsenal. After arms
had been provided for them, it was judged necessary to
march them into Aragon; but they refused to enter that
kingdom, because they had not been sent with that intention,
and in consequence they returned to Valencia
without having faced the enemy. Whenever, indeed,
the Valencian army had faced them, some glaring misconduct
had appeared, and some lamentable disaster
been the necessary result. The spirit of provincialism
ceased to paralyse them when the enemy was within
their own territory, but Suchet still calculated upon
want of discipline in the men, and want of skill in the
leaders; some reliance, too, he placed upon those means
of seduction by which France had triumphed as often as
by her arms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French repulsed in an assault.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The day after he reached Murviedro, he assaulted the
fort at two in the morning; in three places the
escalade was attempted, but the French were repulsed
at all points with the loss of their ladders,
and of more than 400 killed and wounded. Suchet was
induced to make this dangerous attempt by his engineers,
who discovered two old breaches which had not

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mem. 2. 161.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

been effectually repaired, and who were sensible
of the great difficulties they should have to
encounter in a regular siege. His men, too, he says,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
since their exploits at Tarragona, regarded it as pastime
to march to an assault; but the way there had been prepared
for them by corruption. They kept possession of
the town, broke through the party walls of the houses,
that they might communicate without exposing themselves

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">October.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to the garrison’s fire, barricadoed the
streets, and planted guns in those houses which
looked toward the fort. This was not effected without
loss, and they had not yet brought up their battering
train; it was to come from Tortosa, and the little fort of
Oropesa in their rear commanded the road. Suchet
gave directions for reducing this, and acted in the meantime
against the troops in the field. Obispo was attacked
on the 30th at Seneja, and driven back upon Segorbe;
there he rallied, but reinforcements came to the enemy,
which again gave them the superiority; they entered
Segorbe in pursuit of his broken troops, put all who resisted
to the sword, and drove him towards Liria. The
next object of Suchet was to drive Carlos O’Donnel’s
division beyond the Guadalaviar. On the night of October
1st he marched against it; the advanced guard
was attacked and routed at Betero; the main body at
Benaguacil. Little loss was sustained by the Spaniards
in these actions, but they did not contribute to raise the
character of the Valencian troops in the eyes of their
enemies; and Suchet, who knew that the struggle would
be with Blake, endeavoured to provoke that general
into the field, by reproaching him for having remained
idle in Valencia while two divisions of his army were
defeated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Oropesa taken by the enemy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>He had made himself, however, already so far master
of the field, as to continue his operations against Murviedro
without interruption. Oropesa surrendered
on the 11th, after a cannonade of a few
hours; Captain Eyre, in the Magnificent, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
just arrived to assist it, but he came only in time to
bring off the garrison of a tower about a mile distant.
Artillery and tools could now be safely brought from
Tortosa; and a week afterwards a practicable breach
was effected. Twice in the course of a day and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

night the French attempted to storm it, and
were repulsed with great slaughter. The fort, though,
according to the inveterate habit of procrastination
which has for centuries been the reproach of Spanish
policy, its works were incomplete, yet was capable of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>A second assault repelled.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

making a very formidable resistance; for it was
so constructed as to form four parts, each of
which might be defended after the others were
taken. Blake calculated upon the impetuosity of the
enemy, the steadiness of the garrison, and the patriotism
of the governor; the two former did not deceive him:
and he had laid down for himself a wise plan of operations;
which was to abstain from battle, in hope that
the French would weaken themselves in the siege, and
might be compelled to retreat by movements upon their
flank and on the side of Aragon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Guerrilla movements in aid of Murviedro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was part of this plan to surprise the French in
Cuenca, and thus cut off Suchet’s communication
with Madrid: this expedition was committed
to General Mahy, with whom the Conde
de Montijo was to co-operate. The attempt proved ineffectual,
and Mahy returned with his division to join
the commander-in-chief. In Aragon the Spaniards were
led by men of a different stamp, and their movements
would have led to very different results, if the spirit of
provincialism, and that insubordination which long
habits of military independence can scarcely fail to produce,
had not frustrated fair beginnings, and bright
prospects of success. A decree of the Cortes had attached
the guerrilla parties to the armies of their respective<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
districts, and given rank to their leaders,
leaving them to pursue their own system of warfare at
their own discretion, but subjecting them thus to a military
superior whenever they should be called upon. By
virtue of this decree, Duran and the Empecinado, who
commanded, the one in Soria, the other in Guadalaxara,
each with the rank of brigadier, had been ordered by
Blake to unite and enter Aragon, which Suchet had
drained of troops for his expedition against Valencia. It
was not easy to bring these irregular companies under
any restraint of discipline: the Junta of Guadalaxara
were not willing to part with the Empecinado’s band;
the men themselves were not willing to leave what they
considered as their own district; disputes broke out

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dispersion of the Empecinado’s troops.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

among them when their leader was not present;
they turned their arms upon each other at Villaconejos:
after an affray in which some were
killed and many wounded, the rest dispersed, were overtaken
by the French, and suffered great loss; and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>M. del Palacio, Traslado a la Nacion Espanolo, p. 19.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Cuenca was in consequence again entered by
the enemy, who committed their usual enormities
there. The Empecinado, however, was
soon heard of again: he formed a junction with
Duran, and their collected force was computed at about

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>His subsequent successes in conjunction with Duran.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

4000 men. With the greater part of this force
they appeared before the city of Calatayud,
where the enemy had a garrison of between 800

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and 900 men. Not expecting so bold a measure
on the part of the guerrillas, the French
upon sight of them sent out a detachment, who
took post upon an eminence before the city, where there
was a ruined castle. Of that detachment about fifty
were killed, and as many made prisoners, not a man
escaping. The garrison then, and all the persons connected
with them, took shelter in the convent of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
Mercenarios. This edifice had been fortified, and was
one of those posts which gave them military possession
of the country. The Spaniards had no artillery, and
having in vain attempted to burn it, began to mine.
This was a branch of warfare in which they had little
skill and less experience: ... on the third day the mine
was ready; it was exploded, and produced no effect;
two others were immediately commenced. Meantime a
reinforcement of 200 foot and fifty horse, the precursors
of a larger force from Zaragoza, came to relieve the besieged;
... the Empecinado hastened to meet them, routed
them, and chased them as far as Almunia, taking the
colonel who commanded, and more than 200 of their
muskets and knapsacks, which they threw away to disencumber

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

themselves in flight. On the sixth
day of the siege, the match was laid to the second
mine, which produced little more effect than the
first: the third, however, was more successful; it brought
down part of the wall of the church, and the French then
capitulated, on condition that the officers should be sent
to France on their parole. Five hundred men were
made prisoners, and about 150 killed and wounded were
found in the convent. There were found here provisions
and money which had been collected by the intrusive
government: the grain was sold at a fair price to the
inhabitants of the district for seed: this Duran and the
Empecinado thought necessary, that they might lessen
as much as possible the evils arising from the state of
waste to which that part of the country was abandoned.
Soon afterwards more than 3000 French arrived, hoping
to recover the plunder; but the Guerrilla chiefs gave
them no opportunity of effecting this, and the next day
the enemy returned into Navarre, whither they were
recalled to resist Espoz y Mina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>A price set upon the heads of Mina and his officers.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>General Reille, with two divisions, had used his
utmost endeavours to destroy this most enterprising
of the Guerrilla chiefs; and Mina, compelled
once more to break up his little army into
small bodies, had for three and fifty days
eluded the enemy, by continual marches and countermarches
among the mountains, suffering hunger, nakedness,
and every kind of fatigue and privation, with that
unconquerable spirit of endurance which is the characteristic
virtue of the Spaniards. To effectuate his
long-desired object, the French general, in the spirit of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 21.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the wicked government which he served, set a
price upon the heads of these gallant men,
offering 6000 dollars for that of Mina, 4000 for
Cruchaga’s, and 2000 each for those of Gorriz, Ulzurrun,
and Cholin. This detestable expedient failed also. A
traitor, by name D. Joaquin Geronimo Navarro, then
offered to treat with the Guerrilla chief, and win him
over to the intruder’s cause; or, if he failed in this,
to seize him at a conference. Mina obtained intelligence
of this second part of the plot, and when he was
invited to confer with Navarro upon matters which, it
was said, nearly concerned his own interest, and that of
his men, and the welfare of the kingdom, he replied, that
Navarro must come and treat with him in person. The
traitor accordingly appointed a meeting at the village of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Leoz, whither he came, accompanied by D.
Francisco Aguirre Echechuri, D. Jose Pelon,
and Sebastian Irujo de Irocin. Mina, with his adjutant
Castillo, met them, partook of a supper which they had
prepared, listened to their proposals; then, being beforehand
in the intended surprisal, seized them, called in
his assistants, and delivered them over to a council of
war, by whose sentence they were put to death.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
Lord Wellington’s movement upon Ciudad Rodrigo
at this time compelled Marmont to withdraw his troops
from Navarre. Immediately Mina reunited his men,
and occupied Sanguesa. “Vengeance,” he cried, “for
the victims who have been sacrificed because they performed
their duty to their country! While some of
these are at rest in the grave, others in dungeons, or led
away into captivity in France, I will take vengeance for
their wrongs. Arms and ammunition, arms and ammunition,
... I ask arms and ammunition of the nation
and of all Europe, for public and for private vengeance.
My division will carry on the war as long as a single
individual belonging to it shall exist.” From Sanguesa
he looked about him where to annoy the enemy with
most effect: while Duran and the Empecinado were
employed on the right bank of the Ebro, he thought he
might act upon the left, by cutting off the French garrisons.
The first which he assailed consisted of forty foot
and seventy horse, at Egoa de los Caballeros, who kept
close within their fort, in fear of such a visit. While he
was mining the fort, the enemy during the night broke
through the wall on the opposite side, and fled. The
sudden cessation of their fire gave cause for suspecting
what they had done: they were pursued, and twenty of
the cavalry were all who effected their escape to Zaragoza.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mina’s success at Ayerbe.<br /><span class="date">Oct. 16.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

He then marched against Ayerbe, and
began to mine a convent which the French had
fortified there. While he was thus employed,
1100 French, with forty horse, came from Zaragoza
to relieve the besieged, and cut off the Navarrese,
who were only 900. Mina drew off his men as soon as
he heard of their approach, and posted the infantry
upon a height above the road; sending out parties to
harass the enemy, and then fall back upon the main
body. The French advanced, mocking the brigands, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
they called them, and telling them to go to Valencia for
bayonets, and they encouraged each other to attack with
the bayonet, saying the brigands were without that
weapon: but they were repulsed in their attempt to
win the height, leaving nineteen dead and forty-nine
wounded upon the field. They then proceeded to
Ayerbe, received a supply of ammunition there, and
being joined by twenty horse from the garrison, took the
road to Huesca. Mina, though inferior in numbers,
was superior in cavalry, having 200 horse, and of this
superiority he made full use. With 160 horse he
followed close upon the rear of the enemy, and impeded
their march in the plain till his infantry came up. Part
under Cruchaga got upon their left flank, another column
under Barena menaced them in the rear, a flank company
supported this movement, and on the right and in front
Mina brought his cavalry. Unlike the French generals,
who, whenever they boasted of victory, showed the
baseness of their own nature by depreciating and
vilifying their opponents, Mina bestowed the highest
praise upon the courage and discipline of the enemy in
this action. They formed themselves into a square,
closing their files with the utmost coolness as fast as the
men fell. Three times the Spaniards broke them, pouring
in their fire within pistol-shot. They formed a
fourth time; Cruchaga then, after pouring in a volley,
attacked them with the bayonet; at the same moment
they were assailed in the same manner by the rest of the
infantry; they were again broken, and the cavalry began
to cut them down. The commander, seventeen officers,
and 640 men laid down their arms and were made
prisoners. The French cavalry also surrendered; but
thinking that they saw a favourable opportunity for
escaping, they wounded some of the unsuspecting
Spaniards, and rode off. This conduct met with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
merited punishment; they were so closely pursued, that
five only reached Huesca, and two of those were cut
down at the gates; the remaining three were all who
escaped of the whole detachment. Among the Spaniards
Lizarraga fell, who commanded the cavalry that
day. Mina, whose horse had been shot under him,
immediately advanced to Huesca; the garrison had fled,
leaving behind them some of their effects, and five
Spanish officers, who thus received their liberty from the
hero of Navarre.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cruchaga carries off the enemy’s stores from Tafalla.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mina was now embarrassed with his prisoners: he
marched them to the coast, in hopes there to
find means of embarking them for Coruña, and
fortunately the Iris, Captain Christian, was in
sight, and took 400 of them on board. While
he was thus employed, Cruchaga learnt that the French
had collected considerable stores of grain in Tafalla,
relying in perfect security upon the fortifications, where
they had mounted four pieces of cannon, and upon the
situation of that city on the road to Zaragoza, within
reach of succour from Pamplona and Caparrosa. From
Sanguesa he watched the motions of the French. By a
rapid march he reached S. Martin de Ujue, two short
hours distant from the city, and he took such effectual
means for keeping his movements secret, that no intelligence
could be given to the enemy. At daybreak,
he approached Tafalla with that silence which he said
was peculiar to his troops: they surprised the guard, the
French retired within their fort, Cruchaga entered with
music before him, as in triumph, and loaded the grain
upon beasts which he had brought with him for the purpose.
It had not been his intention to attempt any
thing against the enemy’s works: but his men heard
that a priest, a number of peasants, and about thirty
women, were confined in a fortified convent, because<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
they had relations in the service of their country, or
were suspected of favouring their country’s cause; and
they attacked the convent. The French abandoned it,
and fled to their other works, leaving good spoil behind
them to the conquerors. They, however, rejoiced more
in having delivered their countrymen from these oppressors,
than in the important stores which they obtained
by the day’s expedition; and before they left
Tafalla, they drew up in the centre of the city, and the
band played, to comfort, Cruchaga said, the hearts of
the Spaniards!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mina’s object in soliciting for military rank.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mina had obtained military rank for himself and
his officers, and was now colonel and commandant-general
of the division of Navarre, under
which appellation his troops were considered
as attached to the seventh army under Mendizabal.
Pre-eminent as were the services of this chief
and his followers, they did not obtain this rank without
repeated solicitations, and the direct interference of the
Cortes; for the Regency at first would only concede
them the title of <i>urbanos</i><a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>, or local militia. The fitness
of this designation was well exposed by Sr. Terreros:
“They,” said he, “who go among the mountains hunting
the wild beasts of France, and bathing their weapons
in French blood, are local militia! and they who live at
home and drag their sabres at their heels in coffeehouses,
are regulars and veterans!” ... Mina’s object in
soliciting rank in the regular army was, that his men
when they fell into the hands of the enemy might not
be put to death as insurgents; but, like the Empecinado,
and Manso, and Ballasteros, he found that men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
who were equally destitute of honour and humanity
could only be made to observe the ordinary usages of
war by the law of retaliation. Repeatedly and earnestly
had he applied to the French generals, conjuring
them to respect the laws of war; nor did he cease to
remonstrate till farther forbearance would have been a
crime. In the course of two days twelve peasants were
shot by the French in Estella, sixteen in Pamplona, and
thirty-eight of his soldiers, and four officers, were put to
death: Mina then issued a decree for reprisals, exclaiming,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>His decree for reprisals.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that the measure was full. He began
his manifesto by contrasting his own conduct
with that of these ferocious invaders; then
declared war to the death and without quarter, without
distinction of officers or soldiers, and especially including
by name Napoleon Buonaparte. Wherever the
French might be taken, with or without arms, in action
or out of it, they were to be hung, and their bodies exposed
along the highways, in their regimentals, and
with a ticket upon each specifying his name. Every
house in which a Frenchman should have been hidden
should be burnt, and its inhabitants put to death. If
from any village information were given to the enemy
that there were volunteers there, such volunteers not
amounting to eight in number, five hundred ducats
should be levied upon that village, for the information;
and if any volunteer in consequence should have fallen
into the hands of the French, four of that village should
be chosen by lot and put to death. Mina’s anxiety not
to bring the inhabitants into danger is apparent in this
decree; he seems to have thought that if as many as
eight volunteers were in one village, the imminent
hazard of concealing them might exempt the people
from punishment for informing against them. He declared
Pamplona in a state of siege, and the villages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
and buildings within a mile round the walls; within this
line no person was to pass on pain of death; the parties
who should be stationed to observe it were ordered to
fire upon any one who trespassed beyond the bounds
assigned, and if they apprehended him, wounded or
unwounded, to hang him instantly upon the nearest tree.
All persons who wished to leave that city should be
received with the humanity of the Navarrese character;
they were to present themselves to him in person; ... if a
whole family came out, it was sufficient that the head
should appear. Deserters of all ranks were invited by
a promise that they might, at their own choice, either
serve with him or go to England, or return to their own
country; in either of which latter cases, he undertook to
convey them to one of the ports on the coast; and he
decreed the punishment of death against all who should
kill or betray a deserter, or refuse him shelter and assistance.
All persons were forbidden to go beyond the
limits of their respective villages without a passport
from the Alcalde or Regidor, signed by the parochial
priest, or by some other inhabitant in places where no
priest resided: whoever should be apprehended without
one was to be shot: the innkeepers were charged to
demand the passport from all their guests, and seize
every person who could not produce one, and deliver
him over to the first Guerrilla party. If any village
should pay, or influence the payment of the forty <i>pesatas</i>
per week, which the enemy had imposed upon the
parents and relations of the volunteers, (the name by
which Mina always designated his followers,) the property
of the magistrates, priests, and influential persons
of that village should be confiscated at discretion. And
in requital for this imposition of the Intrusive Government,
he imposed a weekly mulct of twice that sum
upon the parents, brothers, and kinsmen, of those persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
who were in the employ of the French at Pamplona.
This decree was to be circulated in all the cities,
towns, valleys, and <i>cendeas</i> (parochial, or district meetings)
of Navarre; it was to be proclaimed every fifteen
days, and to be read by the officiating priest in every
church on the first and third Sundays of every month:
wherever this duty was omitted, the magistrates, priests,
<i>escribanos</i>, or town-clerks, and two of the influential
inhabitants, were declared subject to military

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

punishment. He dated this decree from the
field of honour in Navarre, and the Government ratified
it by inserting it in the Regency’s Gazette.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duran and the Empecinado separate.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The movements of the Guerrilla leaders on the Ebro,
as well as in Navarre and Upper Aragon, made
Suchet feel that he had placed himself in a
situation in which every day that deferred his
success increased his danger; nor was he without uneasiness
on the side of Catalonia, where the Catalans
carried on their warfare with such vigour, that the
French could aim at nothing more than preserving and
provisioning their fortified posts. His communication
with Tortosa was interrupted by the armed peasantry;
scarcity began to be felt in his camp, and he was
obliged to detach 4000 men to protect a convoy going
from Zaragoza. It was Blake’s hope that Duran, the
Empecinado, and Mina, might threaten that city, and
perhaps succeed in delivering it from its oppressors.
The plan was well concerted, and if it had been executed,
Suchet would hardly have ventured to maintain
his ground in the kingdom of Valencia. The attempt,
however, was not made; for some difference arose between
Duran and the Empecinado, and instead of forming
a junction with Mina, they separated from each
other. By this time Murviedro was closely pressed, a
battery of eight four-and-twenty pounders had been constructed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
and the governor made signals of distress. The

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Blake determines to give battle.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Spaniards were eager for battle; and Blake,
foregoing his first and better resolution, consented
to gratify them, in the hope that one
victory, when victory certainly appeared attainable, and
would be of such immense importance, might repay him
for the many disasters which he had sustained. He
advanced, therefore, on the 24th about noon, and took
post for that night on the height of El Puig, his right
resting on the sea, and his left upon Liria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of Murviedro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The country between Valencia and Murviedro is like
a closely-planted orchard, bounded by the sea
on the right, and on the left terminating at some
distance from the foot of the mountains which separate
Valencia from La Mancha, Cuenca, and Aragon. Three
great carriage roads cross this land of gardens; and
by these three roads the attack was to be made; for
though, from the nature of the ground, the left wing
could not be united with the centre and the right, it was
thought that this would be a less inconvenience than
to leave open either of the three roads. It was of especial
consequence to occupy the left road, that of Betera;
for should Suchet, as might be expected, endeavour to
anticipate the attack, he might otherwise send his main
body in this direction, where the mountains would cover
them, and the open country give free scope for his
cavalry and for those manœuvres, in which Blake knew
but too well the superiority of the enemy.</p>

<p>On the next morning the army was put in motion.
Zayas commanded the right, Lardizabal the centre,
Carlos O’Donnell the left, consisting of the Valencian
division under Miranda, and the Aragonese under
Villacampa: Mahy, with the Murcian division, was to
support this wing; Blake, with another body of reserve,
remained upon El Puig. The left wing was to begin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
the attack, relying upon the support which they would
receive from the centre and the other wing, who were to
accompany the movement and cover them on the right:
this, it was thought, would be a resource in case of a
want of firmness on their part, which would not have
been the case had a different disposition been preferred.
If there was an error in Blake’s disposition, it was in
thus trusting the principal attack to that part of his army
upon which he had least reliance.</p>

<p>Suchet, who desired nothing so much as an action,
prepared to meet his antagonist, leaving six battalions
to continue the siege. At eight in the morning his
sharp-shooters were briskly driven back; and from that
moment, he says, he knew that he had to contend with
troops very unlike those of Valencia. Some strong
columns outflanked him on the left, and his right, which
was a league distant from the main body, was outflanked
also by O’Donnell. Both armies began their
movements at the same time: about half way between
them on the left of the Spaniards, where the fate of the
battle was to be decided, was a ridge of ground, which
offered some advantage, and which both parties endeavoured
to gain. The sharp-shooters of O’Donnell’s
division running with eagerness towards this point, drove
back that part of the French cavalry which covered the
enemy’s advance: they got possession, and were supported
by two battalions and some field-pieces; but
their ardour had been inconsiderate, for they had separated
too much from the columns, and the French, who
knew how to avail themselves of every opportunity
which was offered, speedily dislodged them by a well-supported
charge.</p>

<p>This error was fatal; for the want of discipline was
felt in leaving the ground, as it had been in winning it:
one battalion after another, after a feeble resistance, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
thrown into disorder, and abandoned the field. It was
now that Mahy with the reserve should have endeavoured
to support them and retrieve the day, but the
order for him to attack did not arrive in time, and he did
not advance in time without it: and seeing that the
chief efforts of the enemy would now be directed against
him, and that his cavalry abandoned him on their approach,
he immediately commenced his retreat. While
the fate of the left wing was thus decided, Suchet broke
through the centre: not without a brave struggle on the
part of the Spaniards. D. Juan Caro, the brother of
Romana, who commanded a body of cavalry on the left
of the centre, made a desperate charge against the
enemy’s horse, though they were supported by artillery,
and defended by a mud wall. The Spaniards leaped
the wall, Colonel Ric of the grenadiers leading the way,
and cut down the French at their guns. The enemy’s
reserve came up, and the second line of the Spaniards,
which should have supported them, having been unhappily
detached to reinforce the vanguard, the guns were
retaken, and Caro himself was made prisoner.</p>

<p>The centre of the Spanish army was now defeated:
Lardizabal, however, supported the character which he
had gained at Santi Petri, and collecting some cavalry,
checked the enemy and covered the retreat of his troops.
But it was on the right that the Spaniards displayed
most resolution; and had all the army behaved like
Zayas and the division of Albuhera, Blake’s highest
hopes might have been accomplished. They, though
unsupported on their left, cleared the road before them,
and when the day was lost in the other part of the field,
repeatedly repulsed the superior forces which were
brought against them. By the account of Suchet
himself, the action was maintained here with great
slaughter: they covered their left with a battalion in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
mass, and stood their ground till their cartridges were
consumed, ... Zayas then sent for more, but Blake ordered
him to retreat. This movement was admirably
executed, all the wounded were removed, and so little
were the men dispirited, that twice they demanded to
be allowed to charge with the bayonet. They occupied
the houses in the village of Puchole, and fired from the
roofs and windows; but here, by an error, for which the
commandant of the imperialists of Toledo was suspended,
the remains of the Walloon battalion were surrounded
and made prisoners. When the fugitives had
reached Tuna, the reserve was ordered to retreat, and
Zayas brought them off in the face of the enemy.</p>

<p>This was the best action which had yet been fought
by the Spaniards, but it was most unfortunate in its
results, and the issue proved but too plainly that it
ought not to have been hazarded. By the French account
4639 prisoners were taken, four stand of colours,
and sixteen pieces of cannon; the killed and wounded
were estimated at 2000 men; on their own part they
acknowledged only 128 men killed and 596 wounded.
Suchet was struck by a ball on the shoulder, General
Harispe had two horses killed under him, and two others
of the French generals were wounded: the manner in
which they exposed themselves, and the number of
officers of rank whose names appeared among the
wounded, prove that the victory was not achieved without
difficulty, nor without greater loss than the official
account admitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Murviedro surrendered.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The garrison of Murviedro, when they saw the battle
commence, threw their caps into the air with
shouts of joy, calling to their countrymen to
come on to victory. In the evening, Suchet,
leaving his army a league from Valencia, returned to the
camp: a breach had been made during the day, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
was not yet practicable, but by the fire of some hours
longer would have been rendered so; the French general
had no inclination to assault the walls again; ... it
was of consequence, he said, to profit by the victory
which had been gained under the eyes of the garrison; ...
and the governor’s want of constancy, or perhaps of integrity,
enabled him to do this most effectually; for
Andriani had no sooner satisfied himself that General
Caro was really taken prisoner, than, as if the victory of
the French had destroyed all hopes, he capitulated with
more than 2500 men. “Thus,” said the French, “we
became masters of a place which had so long resisted
Hannibal.” Had Andriani been as true to the cause of
his country as the soldiers under him, the second siege
might possibly have become as famous as the first. A
successful assault could only have put the enemy in possession
of a fourth part of the fort, when there would
have been three more breaches to make, and three more

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mémoires, 2. 191.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

attacks. It was the governor’s duty to have resisted
to the last extremity; but to that extremity
he was not reduced. By Suchet’s own statement,
the place was in no danger, and notwithstanding
all the efforts of his engineers and all their skill, nothing
could be less certain than the success of a new
assault.</p>

<p>Blake, in the orders which he issued on the following
day, said that he was dissatisfied with certain corps, and
with some individuals, and that as soon as their cowardice
was juridically proved, he would punish them with all
the rigour of national justice. But in general he declared,
that the conduct both of officers and men, and
especially that of the division under Zayas, had been
satisfactory. “For himself,” he said, “he was sufficiently
accustomed to the vicissitudes of war, not to be
surprised at the ill success of the action, and he was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
the less confident of being able to repel the invasion of
the enemy.” But Blake did not feel the confidence
which he affected. He confessed afterwards, that after
the fall of Tarragona, the loss of Valencia was to be
apprehended; but that the brilliant manner in which
the defence of Murviedro was begun, the forces which
its defence gave time for assembling, and the spirit of
the officers and troops, had given well-founded and flattering
hopes, which continued till this battle extinguished
them. From that moment, he said, nothing but
what was gloomy presented itself; only some political
revolution, or other extraordinary event, which should
deprive Suchet of his expected reinforcements, could
save Valencia; and his plan was to defend the lines
which had been formed for its protection as long as
possible, without entirely compromising the safety of his
army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Valencia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Valencia stands in an open plain, upon the right bank
of the Guadalaviar, about two miles from the
sea. Its old ramparts were at this time in good
preservation; but works of antiquity are of little use
against the implements of modern war. They were thick
walls of brick-work, flanked with round towers at equal
distances, and without moats. The river flows at the foot
of the walls the whole extent of the eastern side, separating
the city from its suburbs; the suburbs, being of
later date than the town, are more open and commodiously
built, and contain a larger population; including them,
the number of inhabitants is estimated at 82,000. The
adjoining country is in the highest state of cultivation;
and the city, from its history, its remains of antiquity,
and the customs of the people, is one of the most interesting
and curious in the whole Peninsula. In no
part of Spain, nor perhaps of Christendom, were there
so many religious puppet-shows exhibited; nowhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
were the people more sunk in all the superstitions of
Romish idolatry, and, if the reproaches of even the
Spaniards themselves may be credited, there was as
little purity of morals as of faith. It is a proverbial
saying, that in Valencia the meat is grass, the grass
water, the men women, and the women<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> nothing. But
if the Valencians were, as a censurer has said of them,
light equally in mind and body, the cause has been
wrongly imputed to their genial and delicious climate;
the state of ignorance to which a double despotism had
reduced the nation, and the demoralizing practices of
the Romish church, sufficiently account for their degradation.</p>

<p>The Guadalaviar at Valencia is about a hundred
yards wide; it is usually kept low, because its waters
are drawn off by canals, which render the adjoining
country like a rich garden; but in the rainy season the
stream is so strong, that it has frequently swept away
its bridges. There are five of these, fine structures,
and so near each other, that all may be seen at once.
Two had been broken down, and the other three were
covered by <i>têtes-de-pont</i>. There had been ample time
to provide for defence, and much labour and much cost
had been bestowed upon the works which were deemed
necessary. A small ditch filled with water was made
round the wall, with a covered way; works also were
constructed to defend the gates; but the Valencians
chiefly relied upon their intrenched camp, which contained
within its extensive line the city, and the three
suburbs upon the right bank. These works were fortified
with bastions, and mounted with 100 pieces of
cannon; they extended from the sea to Olivette; but as
the point in which they terminated was weak, because it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
could be attacked in the rear by the left bank, other
interior works were commenced, for the purpose of insulating
this from the rest of the line. The engineers
relied also upon their command of the river, meaning
to cover the approaches by inundations, and to fill
the fosses of their camp, which might easily be done,
the ground being a low plain intersected by numerous
canals.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suchet summons Valencia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Suchet summoned the city the day after his victory,
saying, that he had taken 8000 prisoners, many
generals, and the greater part of Blake’s artillery,
and calling upon the governor to save Valencia
from the calamities and outrages which a vain resistance
must inevitably draw upon it, and of which all the fortresses
besieged and taken by the French presented
terrible examples. He promised an amnesty for the
past, offered the people his special protection, and
assured them that the French would endeavour, by
generous proceedings, to make them forget the evils of
war, and the horrible anarchy in which they had so long
been plunged. Blake published this summons, and did
not think proper to reply to it; at the same time he
appealed to the people as witnesses of the valour with
which the troops had fought, and the good order in
which they had effected their retreat, for the purpose of
occupying their former position.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He establishes himself in the suburb, and in the port.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The enemy soon closed upon the city, and established
themselves in the suburb called Serrano, on the
left bank of the river, not, however, without
considerable opposition. They won their way
foot by foot, and carried the last house by sapping
and mining. Had the spirit of which the
people here gave proof been properly fostered and directed,
Valencia would have been safe. Having gained
the suburb, they formed a contravallation of three strong<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
redoubts, having seven feet water in their ditches, with
two fortified convents and some houses, to confine the
besieged within their têtes-de-pont. The fire of the
Spaniards was well directed to annoy them during these
operations; but the loss inflicted upon the enemy by no
means counterbalanced the advantage which they had
gained, in possessing themselves of the fortified convents
in the suburb. Next they occupied the Grao, which is
the port of Valencia.</p>

<p>Suchet’s left was now at the Grao, his right at Liria,
and his centre in the suburbs. Using every possible
exertion to ensure success, he brought up in the course
of December 100 four-and-twenty pounders, thirty mortars
and howitzers; and when this formidable train was
ready, and his reinforcements had arrived, he put the
army in motion for decisive operations. On the night
between the 25th and 26th of December, two bridges
were rapidly constructed by the engineers, a league
from Manisses, above all the sources of the different
waters, in order that the troops might not be engaged in
a labyrinth of canals. Blake had posted his infantry
from the sea to Manisses, and his cavalry on more
elevated ground above that village, to cover his left.
He had fortified the villages of Mislata, Quarte, and
Manisses, on the banks of the river, and connected them
by lines with artillery. His great object was to keep
possession of Quarte and S. Onofre; as long as that
was done, and the cavalry retained its position, it would
be in his power either to risk a general action, drawing
from Valencia all the troops for that purpose; or to
evacuate the city, and leaving only a small garrison for
the purpose of capitulating, draw off and save the great
body of the army. And even if the enemy should succeed
in turning the left wing, and thus cut off his
retreat by the great road, it was scarcely possible, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
thought, that the two Cullera roads should be intercepted
on both sides of the lake of Albufera.</p>

<p>The general’s hopes were, as usual, frustrated by the
misconduct of those in whom he trusted, and by the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

rapidity of Suchet’s movements. At daybreak
the two bridges were completed, three divisions
of infantry and the whole of the horse passed, and drove
back the Spanish cavalry; and the French getting possession
of the sluices, turned the waters of the canals
into the river, and thus deprived Valencia of one means
of defence on which she had relied. Another division
crossed the river between Quarte and Mislata to occupy
the Spaniards in front. Here Zayas again displayed
that resolution, and that military skill, which made him
more, perhaps, than any other man at this time the
hope of the Spanish armies; but the troops on the left,
where Mahy commanded, gave way, as they had done
in the former action; they abandoned the intrenchments
at S. Onofre, ... the vital points of the line, ... without
even waiting for an attack, and retired from Manisses
almost upon the first fire. Mahy, with about 5000 men,
reached Alcira, abandoning the artillery; the rest of the
division was unaccounted for; the loss in killed could
have been little or none, and the French made no boast
of the numbers which they had taken; they who were
missing then must mostly have dispersed in their flight,
the unavoidable consequence when men have lost all
confidence in their leaders.</p>

<p>The investment of Valencia was completed before the
close of the day; and Suchet, again turning against the
Spaniards those advantages of which they had so little
availed themselves, secured himself everywhere by the
canals and fosses with which the ground was intersected.
Still the lines remained which the Valencians had for
three years been employed in constructing; but after the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
labour, and the cost which had been expended upon
them, when the hour of need came they were found, or
thought to be, untenable. Blake, with the troops who
were without the city, might still have effected a retreat;
but he wished to save as much of the army as possible,
and to prepare the people for a catastrophe which they
had never looked on to, and to which he perceived they
would not be induced to submit, till they felt the
uttermost necessity. Such, indeed, was their disposition,
that men like Santiago Sass, and D. Pedro Maria
Ric, and such women as the Countess Burita, would
have protected them better than Blake with his army
and all his lines and defences.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The army endeavours to escape.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A council of war was held, and it was agreed
unanimously that the army should endeavour to
effect its escape on the night of the 28th. They
went through the gate of S. Jose; but before
they had gone far, the advanced posts discovered them;
about 300 men made their way to the mountains under
favour of the darkness, about as many more were killed
or drowned in the canals, and the rest withdrew within
their intrenchments, having no confidence in the works,
nor in their general; and their general having none in
them, nor in himself, nor any hope from without or from

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Xativa surrendered.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

within. An event more discouraging than the surrender
of Murviedro occurred the day after this attempt,
for the town of St. Philippe, half way
on the road to Alicante, was given up without opposition
to Suchet’s advanced guard. This place had distinguished
itself in the War of the Succession for its
inflexible fidelity to the Austrian party. The inhabitants
defended themselves, as Marshal Berwick relates,
with unheard-of firmness, maintaining street by street
and house by house, for eight days after his troops were
within the walls; in revenge for which he razed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
town; all the surviving inhabitants were removed to
Castile, and forbidden on pain of death ever to return;
and Philip, when a new town was erected on the ruins,
abolished its old name of Xativa, and imposed upon it
that of St. Philippe.... Even the new race of inhabitants
felt this name as a reproach; and but a few months
before this cowardly surrender, the Cortes, at their
petition, had passed an edict restoring the old appellation.
It was just restored in time to be disgraced. The French
found a great quantity of provisions and a million of
cartridges, ... hoarded there for this shameful end!</p>

<p>While the enemy succeeded thus, almost without
opposition in every thing they attempted, Blake resolved
to make a second trial at escape; but the people

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Blake abandons the lines and retires into the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

compelled him to give up this project, and
remain in patient expectation of a fate which
he no longer made an effort to avert. This
he calls an inconsiderate popular movement;
but the people, who saw their works as yet untouched,
above 16,000 regular troops to defend them, including
the best officers and artillerymen in the service, with
artillery and military stores in abundance, and the population
of the city ready and eager to bear their part
in the defence, might have encouraged a general to
hope, and ought to have inspired him with a more

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1812.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

heroic despair. Suchet opened his trenches on
the first night of the new year; on the fourth
they were advanced within fifty toises of the ditch. Blake
then called another council, the result of which was, that
the lines were abandoned, and the troops retired into the
city, taking with them their field artillery, but leaving
eighty pieces behind.</p>

<p>The French general says, that the astonishing desertion
from the Spanish army induced Blake to abandon
these vast and important works. Blake himself assigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
no such cause, but the desertion must undoubtedly have
been very great, ... a commander who feels no hope can
excite none. The suburb of Quarte was immediately
seized by the enemy, and Suchet bombarded the city
during the whole of the fifth. The next morning he
sent in a summons, “thinking,” he says, “that an army
which had just abandoned works of such strength,
mounted with eighty-one pieces of cannon, would call
loudly for capitulation, now that they saw the effects of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The city a second time summoned.<br /><span class="date">January.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

a bombardment upon a city which at that time
contained no fewer than 200,000 souls.” The
summons was in these words: ... “General, the
laws of war assign a period to the sufferings of the
people; this period has arrived. The imperial army
is now within ten toises of the body of your fortress;
in some hours several breaches may be effected;
and then a general assault must precipitate the French
columns into Valencia. If you wait for this terrible
moment, it will no longer be in my power to control the
fury of the soldiers, and you alone will have to answer
to God and man for the evils which must overwhelm
Valencia. The desire to spare the total ruin of a great
city determines me to offer you an honourable capitulation:
I engage to preserve to the officers their equipages,
and to respect the property of the inhabitants. It
is unnecessary for me to add, that the religion we profess
shall be revered. I expect your reply in two hours,
and salute you with very high consideration.”</p>

<p>Blake replied, “Yesterday, perhaps before noon, I
might have consented to change the position of the
army, and evacuate the city, for the sake of saving its
inhabitants from the horrors of a bombardment; but the
first twenty-four hours which your excellency has employed
in setting it on fire have taught me how much
I may depend upon the constancy of the people, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
their resignation to every sacrifice which may be necessary,
in order that the army may maintain the honour
of the Spanish name. Your excellency may consequently
continue your operations; and as to the responsibility
before God and man, for all the misfortunes
which the defence of the place occasions, and all those
which war brings with it, it cannot attach to me.” This

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suchet expects a desperate resistance.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

reply led Suchet to apprehend he should have to
encounter a Zaragozan resistance. “The general,”
said he in his dispatches, “is no longer the
master; he is obliged to obey the decisions of a fanatical
Junta, composed of seven persons, five of whom are
Franciscan monks, and the other two butchers of Valencia;
the same who, about three years ago, directed the
massacre of 400 French families that were ordered out
of the country. I therefore continue my operations with
vigour against the place, which at this present moment
counts a population of 200,000 souls. Five of the principal
chiefs of the insurgents are now within its walls,
with all their property, and whatever fanatics or madmen
are yet left in Spain. The engineers will open
their works under the walls. The artillery raises formidable
batteries; and notwithstanding the rains, it will in
a few days be able to make a breach in the last enclosure.
The army is waiting with impatience for the
attack, and if we should have to make a war of houses,
as at Zaragoza, it will be rendered of short continuance,
by the ability and rapidity of our miners.”</p>

<p>Had the Valencians resorted to this mode of defence,
Suchet’s miners would have found themselves engaged
in an extraordinary subterranean war, among the Roman
sewers; but after relying so long upon the army, and a
military defence, it was too late to organize the people
for that better system, which, if it had been determined
upon from the first, might have proved successful, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
which, even in its most disastrous termination, would
have added as much to the strength of Spain as to the
honour of Valencia. But Blake had nothing of the
heroic character which had been displayed so eminently
in Zaragoza and Gerona. He was a soldier, skilful
enough in his profession, to have held a respectable,
perhaps a high rank, if he had commanded well-disciplined
troops; and now at the last he performed all that

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>He bombards the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the code of military duty requires. Three days
and nights Suchet bombarded the city, which
was so utterly unprovided for such an attack,
that the people had not even cellars in which to take
shelter: the enemy continued their approaches, till
they had effected a lodgement in the last houses of the
suburbs, and placed mines under two of the principal
gates. Blake then offered to give up the city, on condition
that he might march out with the army. Such
terms were of course rejected; a council of war was
therefore held, and terms of capitulation proposed, to
which Suchet agreed the more readily, because, according
to the system of Buonaparte, he meant to be bound by
them no farther than suited his interest, or his inclination.
The troops were to be made prisoners of war, the
inhabitants and their property protected, and no inquiry
made into the conduct of those who had taken an active
part in the war. In one point the Spanish general exceeded
his powers; forgetting that he was no longer in
a situation to act as one of the Regents, and that even
his free and voluntary act would have required the consent
and approbation of the other members of the executive,
he agreed that the French prisoners in Majorca,
Alicant, and Carthagena, should be exchanged.</p>

<p>This capitulation delivered into the hands of the enemy
16,131 effective troops of the line, besides about 2000
in the hospitals, 1800 cavalry and artillery horses,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
twenty-two generals, Zayas and Lardizabal among

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 9.</span><br />Blake surrenders the city to the army.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

them, 893 officers, and 374 pieces of cannon.
The most irreparable loss was that of fifty good
artillery officers, formed in the school of Segovia,
nearly 400 sappers and miners, and 1400 old
artillerymen. The battle of Ocaña drew after it more
disastrous consequences, but the loss in itself had been
far less severe. Thus terminated General Blake’s unfortunate
career; his failure at Niebla was the only one
of his many misfortunes which was disreputable, but all
experience was lost upon him: often and severely as he
had felt the want of discipline in his troops, his obstinacy
was not to be overcome, and he never would consent
that the Spanish army should be brought into an
efficient state of discipline by the English, though he
had seen that a similar measure had delivered Portugal,
and must have known that it would as certainly deliver
Spain. But though the loss of a general, thus incorrigible
in error, and whose continual ill fortune was such
as almost to deprive the army under him of all hope,
could not be regretted for the sake of Spain, Blake himself,
amid all his errors and misfortunes, maintained the
character of a brave man, and it was not possible to read
his last dispatch without some degree of respect as well
as compassion. “I hope,” said he, “your highness will
be pleased to ratify the exchange which has been agreed
upon, and to transmit orders in consequence to Majorca.
As to what concerns myself, the exchange of officers of
my rank is so distant, that I consider the lot of my whole
life as determined; and therefore, in the moment of my
expatriation, which is equivalent to death, I earnestly
entreat your highness, that if my services have been
acceptable to my country, and I have never yet done
anything to forfeit the claim, it will be pleased to take
under its protection my numerous family.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
Suchet observed the capitulation like a Frenchman of
the new system. He had promised that no man should
be molested for the part which he had taken; but no
sooner was he master of the city, than he sent 1500
monks and friars prisoners into France, and executed in
the public square some of those who were most distinguished
for their zeal in the national cause.</p>

<p class="in0"><span class="firstword">M. Suchet</span> was rewarded for his services with the title
of Duc d’Albufera, and with a grant of the revenues
arising from the lake of that name near Valencia, and
from the domains adjoining. He was told that he had
now to obtain possession of Alicante and Carthagena, and
then the only remaining points from which the war could
be kept up on that side of Spain would be closed. It

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">January.</span><br />Attempt on Alicante.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was, indeed, considered at Cadiz, that Alicante
might soon be expected to fall in consequence
of the loss of Valencia; and Carthagena was regarded
as so insecure, that the Conde de la Bisbal suggested
the propriety of occupying the heights which command it
by a British force. Before this precaution was taken, a
premature demonstration against Alicante had the effect
of putting the inhabitants upon their guard. To secure
the success of Suchet’s operations against Valencia,
Marshal Marmont, pursuant to Buonaparte’s instructions,
had sent General Montbrun, with two divisions of
infantry and one of horse, to co-operate with him, by manœuvring
against the corps of Mahy and Freyre, which
he was either to cut off or compel to return into Alicante;
but his orders were, at all events, to rejoin the army of
Portugal from which he had been detached by the
twentieth of the month at latest. Montbrun reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
Almanza on the day that Valencia capitulated; nevertheless,
in opposition to Suchet’s advice, he persisted in
advancing to Alicante, which he summoned to surrender,
and then throwing in a few shells, commenced his
return toward Madrid, having raised the spirits of the
Spaniards by this unsupported and unsuccessful attempt,
and afforded to a more vigilant enemy an opportunity
which was not lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dénia surrendered.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Suchet followed up his success by sending a division
against the little town and port of Dénia, which,
though protected by a respectable fortress,
was surrendered without resistance: he then sent General
Severoli against Peniscola, a place so strong by
nature, and so well secured by art, that it had obtained
the name of Little Gibraltar, and was, in fact, impregnable

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Peniscola betrayed by Garcia Navarro.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

by any regular attack. But General
Garcia Navarro commanded there: he had been
taken prisoner in 1810, had escaped from France,
was trusted with this important post, and now betrayed
his trust, and entered the Intruder’s service, saying, he
would rather share the fate of his country and submit to
the French, than act under English orders. As this
man was one of the basest traitors who deserted his
country in its need, so was he the most unlucky in
timing his treason; for so great a change was presently
effected in the relative situation of the contending powers,
as to make it apparent even to himself that he had taken
the losing side, and would have only perpetual infamy
for his reward. About the same time, but in a very

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Carrera killed in Murcia.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

different manner, the Spaniards lost General D.
Martin de la Carrera, who had distinguished
himself in the recovery of Galicia, and had
borne throughout the war an honourable name. He
now commanded the cavalry of the Murcian army: a
French detachment from Granada under General Soult,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
the Marshal’s brother, had entered the city of Murcia
and were raising contributions there, when Carrera
attacked them with his advanced guard, gallantly, but
unsuccessfully; for though he took them by surprise,
their numbers were greater than he had expected to
find, and he fell in the market-place, fighting bravely
till the last. The French having sacked the city abandoned
it during the night, and on the morrow Carrera
was interred with all the honours which the inhabitants
could bestow. On that day month his exequies were
performed in the cathedral as a public solemnity, the
General D. Jose O’Donnell, with Generals Mahy, Freyre,
and other officers attending; the foundation of a monument
to his memory was laid upon the spot where he
fell; and O’Donnell and the other officers, touching the
stains of his blood with their swords, swore like him to
die for their country whenever the sacrifice of their lives
should be called for, and added to that vow, one of perpetual
hatred towards the French.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>New constitution.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Cortes, meantime, as if they were equally certain
that the country would be delivered from its
merciless invaders, and that no measures which
they could take would accelerate the deliverance, employed
themselves with unhappy diligence in forming a
new constitution: a small but zealous minority succeeded
in dictating this to their reluctant but less active
colleagues; and in its details, as little regard was paid
to the opinions and feelings of the people, as to the
rights of the aristocracy and the fundamental principles
of the government. The public were far more interested
in a change of the Regency ... for the removal of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Change of Regency.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Blake after his manifold misfortunes was considered
as a gain, even though accompanied with the
loss of an army. The new Regency consisted of the
Duque del Infantado, at that time ambassador in England;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
D. Joaquin Mosquera y Figueroa, who was one
of the Council of the Indies; D. Juan Maria Villavicencio,
a lieutenant-general in the navy; D. Ignacio
Rodriguez de Rivas, of the royal council, and the Conde
de la Bisbal. A new army was set on foot in Murcia,
to supply the place of that which had been carried into
captivity with Blake; and the national hopes were
raised by successes in other quarters, as brilliant as they
were at this time unlooked for.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ballasteros retreats to the lines of St. Roque.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Ballasteros had been appointed to the command in
Andalusia, following a system of war like that
of the Guerrillas, which was best suited both to
his own talents and the indiscipline and wretched
equipment of his troops, he had inflicted more loss upon
the enemy than they sustained from any of the regular
Spanish armies. In vain did M. Soult boast repeatedly
of defeating and putting him to flight; the men who
dispersed to-day collected again on the morrow: and
while the French were rejoicing for having routed him
at one point, they heard that he had re-appeared in
force at another, and made himself felt when he was
least dreaded. In September he landed at Algeziras to
act in aid of the mountaineers of Ronda: a movement
was then planned by the enemy for cutting him off, and
for getting possession of Tarifa, an important point
which they had hitherto neglected, as if in full expectation
that no measures for securing it would be thought
of by the Spaniards and their allies till it should be too
late. After some slaughter of the peasantry and some
partial actions, General Godinot advancing with 5000
men from Prado del Rey, found Ballasteros well posted
in front of Ximena: he retired to collect a stronger
force, and having been joined by two columns under
Generals Barroux and Semele advanced again with from
8 to 10,000 men, meaning to march upon St. Roque,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
occupy the coast, and get possession of Tarifa by a <i>coup
de main</i>. Ballasteros, who had not half that

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 10.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

number in a state of discipline on which any reliance
could be placed, fell back upon the heights of
St. Roque, and took a position on the right of the town:
four days afterwards the French appeared, and endeavoured
to bring on an engagement; but Ballasteros
knew his own weakness: he fell back upon the old
Spanish lines, and all the inhabitants of St. Roque
flying from their town, took shelter under the guns of
Gibraltar. The French invited them to return to their
houses, with promises of security and protection; but
bitter experience had now taught the Spaniards what
French protection meant, and they threw themselves
upon the compassion of their allies. Rations were
allotted both for them and the Spanish troops, and the
reservoirs and tanks were emptied for their use.</p>

<p>So busy and so stimulating a scene had not been witnessed
from Gibraltar since the last siege of the rock.
The fugitives, without any other accommodation or
means of subsistence than what charity could supply
them, were scattered about in all directions near the
bay-side barrier; the French occupied the heights, and
Ballasteros, with his hardy and half-naked bands, remained
under protection of the rock, waiting in hope that
want would soon compel the enemy to retire, for previous
arrangements had been made for annoying them in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tarifa attempted by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the rear and cutting off their supplies. Godinot
was not more successful in his design of seizing
Tarifa. Aware that such an attempt would be
made, and warned by the example of Tarragona to take
measures for resisting the enemy in time, the Spanish
government dispatched a force under D. Francisco de
Copons to garrison the town; and 1000 British infantry,
with a detachment of artillery under Colonel Skerrett,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
embarked at the same time for the same service. This,
it was supposed, would also operate as a diversion in
favour of Ballasteros. The British troops landed on the
very day that Ballasteros fell back under the rock; but
a strong easterly gale delayed the Spanish part of the
expedition. On the 18th about 1500 of the enemy advanced
against Tarifa by the pass of La Pena; but the
road could be commanded from the sea, and our vessels
fired upon them with such effect that they turned back.
Godinot meantime felt severely the want of supplies;
for the mountaineers of Ronda, and the parties which
Ballasteros had appointed for that purpose, intercepted
his communications and cut off his detachments. Three
days, therefore, after his ineffectual demonstration against
Tarifa, he retreated by Ximena upon Ubrique. Ballasteros
was soon at his heels, and falling upon the division
which composed the rear-guard, put it to flight, pursued
it for three leagues, and brought away prisoners, knapsacks,
and arms in abundance. He soon obtained a
more important advantage: dividing his army for the
purpose of deceiving the enemy, he collected it by a

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

general movement from different directions to
one point, in the village of Prado del Rey, and
marching from thence by night, surprised Semele at
daybreak. This general had taken his station at Bornos
upon the right bank of the Guadalete, with 2000 foot,
160 horse, and three pieces of artillery. All the mules
and baggage fell into the hands of the Spaniards;
about 100 prisoners were taken, and the corps was put

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to flight. This fresh misfortune proved fatal to
Godinot, whom Soult recalled to Seville. On
his arrival in the evening he went to rest; early the
next morning he came out of his chamber, took the
musket of the sentry unobserved, and blew out his own
brains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
The plans of Marshal Soult, however, were not to be
frustrated by partial reverses, though they were impeded
by them. France has rarely or never had an abler man
in her service than this general, nor one who might have
attained a higher reputation, if his consummate abilities
had not been devoted to the service of a tyrant, and
sullied by cruelties which bring disgrace upon France
and upon human nature. He had lost Tarifa by relying
too confidently on the supineness and inattention of the
allies. The French entered it when they first overran
Andalusia; and having, as they thought, taken possession,
passed on to other points of more immediate importance.
The governor of Gibraltar, General Colin
Campbell, seized the opportunity, and occupied it with
about 250 men and thirty gunners under Major Brown
of the 28th. A few weeks afterwards, a thousand
French arrived to garrison it: the general hatred of the
Spaniards prevented them from getting any information
but what their own people, and the few traitors whom
they had seduced, could supply; and their troops were
under no little surprise when they found the gates closed
against them. They drew up below the eastern hills,
within musket-range, and poured their bullets into the
town; and they entered the suburbs, where several of
our men were killed; but they were without artillery,
and seeing a detachment issue through the sea-gate to
take possession of the south-east hills, and bring some
guns to bear upon their flank, they hastily retired, and
made no farther attempt to occupy the place, till this
time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tarifa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Tarifa is believed to have been a settlement of the
Phœnicians. It derives its present name from
Tarik, who first led the Moors into Spain, and
who is said to have built the castle. The town had long·
been declining, till the late wars in which Spain had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
been involved with England, in consequence of her unhappy
connexion with France, gave it a new importance:
for a little island which stands out boldly into the Straits
off the town rendered it a favourable station for gun boats;
and during the late war these boats inflicted
greater losses upon the trade of Great Britain than it
suffered from all the fleets of all her enemies. There
were two half-moon batteries and a martello tower on
the island; but when the Spaniards at the commencement
of this dreadful struggle formed their alliance with
Great Britain, these works, with the whole line of defence
along the Straits, were dismantled, lest the French
should at any time turn it against the best ally of Spain.
The enemy occupied no point which in so great a degree
commanded the straits; and Soult was now the more
desirous of obtaining it, because he was at this time
negotiating with Morocco, and the possession of Tarifa,
which is only five leagues distant from Tangiers, would
render it impossible for England with all her naval
means to prevent him from receiving corn; and thus the
difficulty of supplying the French armies would be
greatly lessened, if not altogether removed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tarifa regarrisoned by the English.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The little garrison which had saved this important
place was withdrawn for the expedition under
Generals Lapeña and Graham, and when the
latter re-entered the Isle of Leon, he left Tarifa
uncovered; but General Colin Campbell a second time
secured it, by sending thither the marines from the ships
at Gibraltar. Soon after it was re-garrisoned, Major
King of the 82nd was appointed to the command, and
he and the Spanish governor, D. Manuel Daban, delayed
not to take precautions against a danger, the
approach of which now began to be apprehended.
Piquets were placed at La Pena, at Facinas, and Port
Alanca, and provisions were laid in for a siege. The
first movement of the enemy indicated their ultimate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
object; D. Antonio Begines de los Rios, an officer who
had distinguished himself daring General Lapeña’s
expedition, and who was now stationed at Algeziras,
made a representation of the approaching danger, and
General Campbell directed that some field works should
be thrown up on the island to secure a retreat, in case a
retreat should be unavoidable. These works excited
some jealousy in the governor; but Major King explained
to him their use and necessity; and Ballasteros,
who inspected them about the same time, expressed in
animated terms his gratitude to the British nation,
seeming at that time, like a brave and generous man, to
feel no petty suspicions, or lingering of old prejudices,
or resentment of false and ill-directed pride.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col. Skerrett and Copons arrive there.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the middle of October, Colonel Skerrett arrived
with about 1200 men, and took the command of
the garrison; and in a few days D. Francisco de
Copons followed him with 900 Spaniards and
about 100 cavalry. The Spanish general demanded
that the keys of the town should be given up to him,
and Colonel Skerrett would have acceded to this, if it
had not been represented, that his predecessors had
kept possession of the keys, first to guard against any
treachery; secondly, because the brother of the governor
was in the French service; and, thirdly, as it was more
conformable to the honour of the British nation. The
validity of the two former reasons had been but too often
proved: the latter might well have been dispensed with;
on the part of England there was no point of honour
implicated, and the British officer acted as he did for
the welfare and security of Spain. The question was
referred by Colonel Skerrett to Governor Campbell’s
decision; and the rapid approach of the enemy, and the
hearty co-operation of the allies against him, removed all
jealousies which otherwise might have arisen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French invest the town.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French advanced in such superior numbers, that
little attempt could be made to oppose or impede
them. They took possession of the surrounding
hills on the 19th of December, and
lighted fires, which were supposed to be for the purpose
of misleading our gun-boats; for these vessels annoyed
them materially by keeping up a brisk fire upon the pass
of La Pena and the hills near the beach. By the following
night the town was closely invested, after a warm
day’s work, in which the artillery on both sides played
with destructive effect. One of the enemy’s shells killed
an artillery driver and eight artillery horses; fourteen
Spaniards were killed by another. The allies lost
seventy-one in killed and wounded; the loss of the
enemy was also great. Four ten-inch mortars on the
island were seen to do terrible execution; one of their
shells burst in the centre of a column, and towards
evening, when the enemy were most heated and exposed
themselves most, they were evidently checked by the
unexpected resistance which they met with. The siege
was now fairly commenced, and the cavalry and staff-horses,
as no longer useful, were sent to the island, from
thence to be embarked on the first opportunity. An
account of the enemy’s force was obtained from a serjeant
who was brought in prisoner; there were 11,000
men, he said, with eighteen pieces of cannon, long sixteen
pounders, and two howitzers; Marshal Victor commanded.
The prisoner entreated that he might not be
given up to the Spaniards. When he was asked whether
he thought the French would succeed in the siege, he
replied, “That their Emperor Napoleon had given them
positive orders to take the place, and he generally provided
means adequate to the end in view.” The man
appeared sensible and well informed; this confidence in
the wisdom with which their operations were directed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
was probably common to the whole French army, and it
constituted half their strength.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Doubts whether the town could be defended.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The allies were not equally confident that they should
be able to defend the place; and the commanding-officer
of the flotilla surveyed the coast of
the island, to fix upon a spot for embarking the
garrison, if they should be compelled to evacuate both
posts. A precaution of this kind, if it had been publicly
known, might have contributed, by disheartening
the men, to produce the catastrophe which it seemed to
anticipate; but it was the duty of the commanders to
think of the worst result, while they hoped and acted
for the best; and when they remembered what weak
walls and insufficient works were opposed to a numerous
enemy, experienced in all the arts of war, and more
especially in the attack of fortified places, it was not
without good reason that they thought it expedient to
provide a place for embarkation. Hitherto, however,
the defence had been well and fortunately conducted;
and the fire of the gun boats and from the island was so
well directed, that great part of the enemy’s stores and
their heavy artillery had not yet been able to come
through the pass of La Pena. By daybreak on the 24th,
the French had brought their approaches within 400
yards, immediately opposite the north-east tower. That
morning an express arrived from Cadiz, with orders for
Colonel Skerrett to embark his brigade: a council of war
was held, but not for the purpose for which such councils
under such circumstances are usually convened; ... a
right spirit prevailed among the British officers, and they
determined that the place should not be abandoned. To
go once in his life, as Colonel Skerrett had done, to the
relief of a besieged town, and see its imminent distress,
without bearing part in its defence, was sufficient grief
for a brave and generous man; the French had insulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
and vilified him for not having done at Tarragona what
no want of will prevented him from doing; opportunity
was now given him of showing them his real character,
and he did not fail to improve it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">December.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the night between Christmas eve and Christmas
day, the French broke ground opposite the east
tower at 400 yards distance, and on the following night
they strengthened their approaches at all points, and
advanced 150 yards nearer to the east and north-east
towers. At both points they opened a fire from a number
of wall-pieces, and fired musketry and wall-pieces through
pyramids of earth-sacks from the summit of one of the
hills. Thence they poured their bullets over the whole
town, but the men were so well covered that little hurt
was done. The fire of the garrison was equally brisk
and more successful; ... it was not, however, possible to
prevent the enemy from advancing in works, carried on
upon the perfect rules of art; and in case it should be
found impossible to maintain Tarifa, final arrangements
were made for the order of retreat, and signals established
with the island, to signify when the island was to fire on
the breach, the suburbs, and on the town, so that our
troops might be saved from any error in the possible
confusion, and as much loss as possible inflicted on the
assailants.</p>

<p>A heavy fire was opened on the 29th from two batteries;
one bore upon the flotilla boats, which were then
at anchor in the eastern bay, and they were fain to cut
their cables and put to sea. This battery then threw
shot and shells to almost every part of the island. The
men received little hurt, for they were at work at the
traverses; but two of the female inhabitants of the town,
who had taken refuge there, were wounded, one losing
a leg, and several horses and mules were killed. The
other was a breaching battery planted in the valley,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
nearly opposite the Retiro tower, at three hundred yards
distance. By the evening a breach about five feet wide
was made to the right of this tower. The eastern tower
was as yet untouched, but the enemy approached it by
sap within fifty yards. Some of the inhabitants were
killed and wounded in the course of the day retreating
to the island. The men suffered little, for they were
ordered to keep under cover. Their spirit was manifested
upon an occasion which might have led to the
worst consequences. One of our artillery officers spiked
two guns; the troops were exceedingly indignant when
it was whispered among them, and they expressed their
discontent at the apprehension of being made to abandon
the town, without having a fair set-to with the
enemy. General Copons appeared highly enraged when
he was informed of what had been done; and the temper
which both Spaniards and English displayed at this circumstance
taught them how well each might rely upon
the other in this their common cause.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 30.</span><br />The garrison summoned.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The next day, by ten in the morning, the breach
had been enlarged to three-and-twenty yards,
and about noon a flag of truce arrived; ... it was
a service of danger to carry it, the day being
so foggy, that the flag could scarcely be seen.
General Leval who commanded the besieging troops,
summoned the governor, saying, “that the defence made
by the fortress under his command had sufficiently established
that fair name which is the basis of military
honour: that in a few hours the breach would be practicable,
and that the same honour which had prompted
him to resistance, imposed it now as a duty upon him
to spare the lives of a whole population, whose fate was
in his hands, rather than see them buried amid the ruins
of their town.” Copons answered in these words:
“When you propose to the governor of this fortress to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
admit a capitulation, because the breach will shortly be
practicable, you certainly do not know that I am here.
When the breach shall be absolutely practicable, you
will find me upon it, at the head of my troops to defend it.
There we will negotiate.” After receiving his reply, the
French renewed their fire upon the breach, but most of
the balls passed through it into the houses which stood
opposite.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French repulsed in an assault.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Preparations were now made on both sides for the
assault, and at eight on the following morning
the enemy advanced from their trenches in every
direction. 2000 of their men moved by the bed
of the river in front of the breach; the 87th regiment
flanked the breach to the north and south, leaving two
companies in reserve to bayonet the assailants if they
should leap the wall. This, however, was not much
to be apprehended; for the town is built in a hollow,
and in that part the wall on the inside was fourteen feet
lower than on the out. The breach opened into a narrow
street, which had been barricaded on each side,
and was well flanked and secured with <i>chevaux-de-frize</i>,
for which the iron balconies, commonly used in Spanish
towns, furnished ready and excellent materials. When
Colonel Gough saw them advancing, he drew his sword,
threw away the scabbard, and ordered his band to
strike up the Irish air of <i>Garry-Owen</i>. The men immediately
cheered, and opened their fire. The 47th, who
lined a wall which descended from the south-east
tower, and flanked the enemy’s columns, did the same,
and the carnage made among the enemy was such, that
they halted for a moment, as if dismayed, then ran to
the edge of the breach. This they saw was impracticable,
and hurrying off under the wall, they made a dash at
the portcullis. Here the barricade was impenetrable, and
finding themselves in a situation where courage could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
of no avail, and where they were brought down by hundreds,
they fled. Colonel Gough seeing them fly, bade
his band strike up <i>St. Patrick’s Day</i>, and the men were
so inspirited, that it was scarcely possible to restrain
them from pursuing the fugitives up to their very
trenches<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>.</p>

<p>The enemy suffered severely in their flight; hand-grenades
from the houses were thrown upon those who
fled by the wall, in hope of security, and a six-pounder
on the north-east tower flanked them. The two leading
officers of the column remained under the wall, and
were taken prisoners. A flag of truce was soon sent, to
ask permission to bury the dead. About 500 had fallen;
and it was a miserable sight to see the wounded crawling
under the breach: about forty, many of whom were
officers, were brought into the town. On the part of the
garrison ten were killed and seventeen wounded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">January.</span><br />Effects of a storm on both parties.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The old year was now terminated with triumph and
rejoicing at Tarifa, but the new one came in
with mourning. A dreadful storm of wind and
rain came on from the eastward, and two Spanish
gun-boats, full of fugitives from the town,
were wrecked under the guns of the island. Two-and-forty
persons perished. The inhabitants who were
hutted on the eastern side of the island, were overwhelmed
by the surge, all lost their property and many
of them their lives. Many more perished by the storm
than had fallen in repelling the assault. The weather,
however, brought with it some compensation to the
Spaniards for this destruction; the few shells which
the enemy threw during the day fell dead, giving proof
that their ammunition had suffered, and neither that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
day nor the next did they make any farther attempt on
the breach, nor move any of their guns to batter a more
assailable point. During the night of the first, the
wind blew up many of the tents on the island, and exposed
the men to the storm. On the second, the rain
increased, and the wind fell; in the course of the
ensuing night, a party sallied, and found the lower
trenches of the enemy so flooded by the rains, that their
piquets had abandoned them. Some deserters now came
in, and declared that two regiments had refused to
assault the breach a second time; that the sufferings
which they endured from the weather had excited a mutinous
expression of discontent among the foreigners in
their army and that Victor had, in consequence of these
things, thought it necessary to send for Soult, who was
arrived, and now at the convent of La Luz. Other deserters
confirmed this account, and added, that there
were about 1000 sick, and that the swelling of the
rivers cut off their supplies, and was likely to cut off
their retreat.</p>

<p>The besieged did not rely too confidently upon their
good fortune, and these favourable tidings, which all
appearances, as far as they could, seemed to corroborate.
Ballasteros, with 2000 of his best troops, embarked at
Algeziras, to assist in the defence of Tarifa; but the
weather prevented him from sailing, and the commander
seeing that the enemy were removing their guns
higher up, and expecting that another breach would be
made, applied to General Colin Campbell for a reinforcement.
The light companies of the 9th regiment
were immediately dispatched, and landed in the course
of the day, and in the following night farther succours
arrived. Toward evening, a column of the enemy was
seen advancing from La Luz, and a deserter brought
intelligence that they proposed to attack at the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
time the town, the island, and St. Catalina, ... a conical
hill on the land side of the isthmus, which was occupied
as an outwork to the island; if they failed in these
simultaneous attacks, they meant to raise the siege.
About an hour after night had closed, they approached
close to the eastern wall, and poured a fire of musketry
into the town; the whole of the garrison immediately
repaired to their alarm posts, and the guards on the
wall returned their fire with good effect. It was intended
only for a feint, and the enemy presently withdrew.
About midnight, the garrison were again called
out by a firing on all sides of the town; the firing suddenly
ceased, and a little before daybreak it was discovered
that the enemy had retreated during the darkness.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

When morning opened, nothing but their
rear guard was in sight; the light troops pursued
them as far as the river Salado, ... memorable as
the place where the Moors made their last great effort
for the conquest of Spain, and where they received
from the allied armies of Castille and Portugal one of
the greatest and most important defeats which history
has recorded.</p>

<p>The French buried their cannon and left behind them
great part of their stores, and what they attempted to
remove, the weather and the state of the roads compelled
them to abandon upon the way. Their loss was
computed at not less than 2500 men, ... a number exceeding
that of the garrison. The siege had continued
seventeen days; the wall in front of the town was but a
yard thick, and incapable of bearing heavy artillery; a
breach had been open in it for seven days. Here for
the first time, the French learned in what manner
Englishmen could defend stone walls, and Lord Wellington
was about to show that they could attack them
with the same spirit and the same success.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Gen. Hill occupies Merida.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>General Hill, after his surprisal of the French at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
Arroyo Molinos, had returned to his cantonments in
Alentejo, watching an opportunity for a second
blow. Towards the end of December, he made
a rapid movement upon Merida in the hope of
surprising them there also, but this was in part frustrated
by the accident of falling in with a detachment
which was on a plundering excursion, and which retreating
with great skill and bravery before our advanced
guard, gave the alarm. Upon this the enemy evacuated
the city, leaving unfinished the works which
they were constructing for its defence, and abandoning
a magazine of bread and a considerable quantity of
wheat. The British general, then hearing that Drouet
was collecting his troops at Almendralejo, marched
upon that town: but the French had retired, leaving
there also a magazine of flour; the state of the weather
and of the roads, which were daily becoming worse,
prevented General Hill from pursuing; having, therefore,
cleared this part of Extremadura of the French (for
they retreated to the south), he cantoned his troops in
Merida and its vicinity, and waited for other opportunities
and a fairer season.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Attempt to carry off Soult.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Guerrillas failed about the same time in an
attempt which, if it had proved successful,
would in the highest degree have gratified the
vindictive spirit of the Spaniards. Zaldivar
laid an ambush for Marshal Soult, and if a goatherd had
had not apprized him of his danger, that able commander
would have been at the mercy of men as
merciless as himself. A successful achievement by D.
Julian Sanchez perhaps induced Zaldivar to undertake
this well-planned, though less fortunate, adventure.
That chieftain, soon after the relief of Ciudad Rodrigo,
formed a scheme for driving off the cattle, which had
been introduced into the city, and were driven out every
morning to graze under the guns of the place. He not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
only succeeded in taking the greater part of them, but
made the governor, Regnauld, prisoner, who with

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 15.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

a small escort had crossed the Agueda, thinking
himself perfectly safe, within sight of the fort and
under its guns. About the same time an accident occurred,
which showed the gratitude as well as the enterprise
of the Spaniards. Colonel Grant, of the Portugueze

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col. Grant rescued by the Guerrillas.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

army, who had on many occasions distinguished
himself, was surprised at El Aceuche,
and made prisoner. D. Antonio Temprano, who
commanded a squadron of hussars, obtained intelligence
that he had passed through Oropesa, on the way to
Talavera; “and because,” he said, “of the singular
estimation in which this officer deserved to be held for
his services,” he determined, if it were possible, to
rescue him: for this purpose he placed an ambush
within shot of Talavera during five successive days;
and on the fifth, succeeded in delivering Colonel Grant
and a Portugueze officer, his companion in misfortune,
at a time when they both expected to be consigned to
hopeless captivity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of feeling at Madrid.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>That Temprano’s detachment should have remained
five days so near a populous city like Talavera,
and no information be given to the French garrison,
is one of the many proofs which were
daily occurring, how entirely the Spanish people hated
the government which Buonaparte was endeavouring to
force upon them. Meantime, even from Madrid, in
spite of the vigilance of a French police, and the rigour
of a military government, which, knowing itself to be
detested, sought only to maintain itself by fear, the
inhabitants found means of sending not only intelligence,
but even supplies, to their brethren in arms. It is
related in one of the Spanish journals, as a proof of the
patriotism of the capital, and the confidence which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
Spaniards there placed in each other, that a lady gave
into the hands of a carrier, whom she met in the street,
and had never seen before, a large bundle of lint and
bandages, for the nearest military hospital of her countrymen,
and it was accordingly delivered to the Junta of
Leon, to be thus disposed of. Romana’s army was
clothed by contributions from Madrid.</p>

<p>The ambition of the French government has been at
all times well seconded by the activity and talents of its
subjects, and by that lively interest, which more than
any other people they feel for the glory of their country;
but its policy has always been counteracted by other
parts of the French character. While the Intrusive
Government and the generals upon every occasion reminded
the Spaniards that they were orthodox Roman
catholics like themselves, and that the English were
heretics endeavouring thus, by raising religious animosities,
to excite disunion between them and their allies,
they could not refrain from outraging the feelings of
the Spaniards, by the grossest mockery of all things
which were held sacred. Masquerades were given at
Madrid on the Sundays in Lent, and the people were
shocked at seeing masks in the characters of nuns, friars
and clergy in their surplices, in the public places of
promenade, and at the theatre. They were still more
offended at beholding one in episcopal habits, and
another with a cope, and the other habits of the altar.
At Albarracin and Orihuela, the French gave balls, and
exhibited a bull-fight on Holy Thursday, the cost of
which they levied upon the villages round about. “The
robbery,” said the Spaniards, “can surprise no one after
our long experience of their insolence and rapacity; but
that which wounds to the quick a feeling and pious
soul, is the atrocious and sacrilegious insult which these
wretches offer to human nature, and to the religion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
that God whom they profess to adore. Common
banditti commit murder after robbery, ... but to suck the
blood of a victim, to expose him to a thousand torments,
and to compel him after all to outrage religion, the only
consolation and hope which he has left, and to make
him with his last tears deplore the most sacrilegious
of their excesses, this is peculiar to Buonaparte and his
soldiers.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of the country.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The conduct of the French in other respects was
such as heightened this feeling of abhorrence;
everywhere the people groaned under their exactions,
their cruelties, and their intolerable insolence.
It seemed as if it were the wish of Buonaparte and his
ferocious agents utterly to depopulate a country which
they found it impossible to subdue. Dreadful as war
always is, no ordinary war could have brought upon any
nation such complicated miseries. It was impossible for
those even who would have been contented to bow, like
bulrushes, before the storm, to obtain security by any
course of conduct; the orders of the Intrusive Government
were met by counter orders from the legitimate
authority; and they who obeyed that authority were, on
the other hand, exposed to the penalties enacted in the
Intruder’s name. Buonaparte and his wicked agents
expected to govern Spain by terror, little thinking, when
the plan of usurpation was laid, that the character of the
nation would compensate for the imbecility of its rulers;
that his system of terror would be met by counter terrors;
and that the people for whom he proclaimed there
was no safety but in obedience would, on their part,
proclaim that obedience, when carried farther than mere
passive and inevitable submission to immediate force,
was a crime which would draw upon the temporizing
and the timid the very evil they sought to avert. Nothing
but that patient, persevering, obstinate, inflexible,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
and invincible spirit of local patriotism which for more
than two thousand years has distinguished the Spaniards
above all other nations, could have supported them
through such a struggle; while the allies, by whom,
under Providence, their deliverance was to be effected,
were acquiring confidence in their own strength, and
experience, and some of that wisdom in which at the
beginning of the contest they were lamentably wanting.
But, meantime, the sufferings of the Spaniards were of
the severest kind, and as general as they were severe.
There was scarcely a family in the Peninsula, from the
highest to the lowest, of which some member had not
been cut off by the sword. The affluent were deprived
of their property; the industrious of their employment;
men of letters were bereaved of the books and papers
which had been the occupation and delight of their
laborious, and honourable, and disinterested lives; and
they who had grown grey in convents were driven out
to beg for bread among those who were themselves
reduced to want.</p>

<p>The Intruder, meantime, was in a condition which
was truly pitiable, if one who had allowed himself to
be made the ostensible cause of such wide-spreading
misery and desolation had not forfeited all claim to pity.
This phantom of a king had neither money to pay his
ministers and dependents, nor authority over the armies
which acted in his name. The Frenchified Spaniards
who composed his ministry, and the French generals,
agreed in despising him, ... this being almost the only
point in which they agreed: on the part of Urquijo
Azanza, and their colleagues, there was some commiseration
mingled with their contempt; their object had
been to effect a change of dynasty, under the protection
of France, not to reduce Spain to the state of a province;
and they could not perceive that Joseph Buonaparte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
was the mere puppet of his perfidious brother,
without self-reproaches and unavailing regret. For
their own sakes, therefore, they preserved the forms of
respect toward him; but the generals were restrained
by no such feeling; they set his orders at nought, and
looked only to France for instructions. The object of
the officers was to enrich themselves by pillage; that
of the commanders was to carve out dukedoms, and
provinces, and principalities, which they might govern
by the sword while Buonaparte lived, and perhaps
maintain for themselves by the same tenure after his
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Intruder goes to France.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sick of his miserable situation, the Intruder went to
France, to represent the deplorable state of
Spain, and press upon Buonaparte the necessity
of providing an adequate support for the
government which he had established, if he could
not send into the Peninsula such a force as should
expel the English, and bear down all resistance. He
himself perhaps would have rejoiced if Buonaparte
would have executed his old threat of annexing Spain
to the French empire, and treating it openly as a
conquest, ... for Joseph had neither the talents nor the
temper of an usurper: without virtue to refuse obedience
to his tyrannical brother, and yet without those vices
which would make him heartily enter into his plans,
his only resource was in sensualities, for his criminal
compliance had left him no other consolation. This
propensity he would far rather have indulged in retirement
and security: but the views and wishes of his
ministers were widely different: the direct usurpation
of Spain by Buonaparte would have reduced them at
once to insignificance, and placed them upon a level
with Godoy, whom they, perhaps, as well as their worthier
countrymen, regarded as a traitor; for certain it is,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
that among these unhappy men there were some who
began their career with good feelings, and a sincere love
of their country, and who were betrayed by error and
presumptuousness, and their connexion with France,
into guilt and infamy. They dreaded nothing so much
as Joseph’s retirement, and rejoiced in his return to
Spain as at a triumph.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distress both of the Intrusive and Legitimate Government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It suited not the immediate policy of Buonaparte
to displace his brother. Moscow instead of
Madrid occupied at this time his ambitious
thoughts, and supplying with men the Intrusive
Government, he left it to shift as it could for
means. So distressed was Joseph for money, that the
plate of the royal chapel at Madrid was sent to the
mint, though such an act would make him at once
odious for sacrilege, and contemptible for poverty, in the
eyes of the people. In want of other funds for his
emissaries to America, he sent a large quantity of quicksilver
to be sold at Alicante: the governor there discovered
for what use the produce was designed, and
seized 1700 <i>arrobas</i>, and the agents who had it in
charge. A great effort was made to pay some of the
public arrears on Buonaparte’s birthday, the fifteenth
of August, for which day St. Napoleone had been foisted
into the Spanish calendar. 100,000 <i>reales de vellon</i>
were paid on this anniversary to the ministers. Lledo,
the comedian, received 18,000, and 100 each were distributed
to some ladies of rank, who were reduced to
petition the Intruder for bread! A bull-fight was given
at Madrid on this day, at which all the bulls were
white; long preparation therefore must have been necessary
for collecting them: D. Damaso Martin, the
Empecinado’s brother, carried off from the meadows of
Puente de Viveros 300, which had been destined for
these ferocious sports in the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
The legitimate government, meantime, was not less
distressed than that of the Intruder: as far as the contest
lay between them, it was carried on on both sides
almost without any certain revenue on which either
could rely. The chief resources of the Spaniards, at
the commencement of the struggle, had been in America,
and these had been cut off by a series of deplorable
events, in which it is difficult to say which of the opposite
parties was most culpable. This was now the fourth
year of the war; the spirit of the people, and the defects
of their military system, had been abundantly proved;
nothing was wanting but to remedy those defects by
raising an army under the direction of Lord Wellington,
who had delivered Portugal, and might by similar
means speedily and certainly have delivered Spain.
Many causes prevented this; one is to be found in a jealousy
or rather dislike of England, which had grown up
in the liberal party with their predilection for republican
France, and which continued with other errors from
the same source, still to actuate them. The pride of
the Spanish character was another and more widely
influencing cause: the Spaniards remembered that their
troops had once been the best in the world; and this
remembrance, which in the people so greatly contributed
to keep up their spirit, in the government produced only
a contented and baneful torpor which seemed like infatuation.
The many defeats, in the course of four years,
which they had sustained, from that at Rio Seco to the
last ruinous action before Valencia, brought with them
no conviction to the successive governments of their
radical weakness and their radical error. After Lord
Wellington had driven Massena out of Portugal, it was
proposed that the command of the frontier provinces
should be given him, and that an army should be raised<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
there under him: it was debated in a secret sitting, and
rejected by an hundred voices against thirty.</p>

<p>“There are three classes of men,” said Dueñas, “who
will break up the Cortes, unless the Cortes breaks down
them: they who refuse to acknowledge the sovereignty
of the nation, calling it a mere chimera, and saying there
is no sovereignty except that of the king; they who
distrust our cause, and say that the few millions who
inhabit Spain cannot make head against all Europe;
and, lastly, they who imagine, that as the French have
conquered while they despise God, we may do the
same.” The deputy’s fears of the first and third of
these classes were groundless, and there were but few
of the second, ... but few Spaniards who despaired of
Spain. Nothing, however, could tend so much to increase
their number as the conduct of the government; it
might well be feared that a system, if system it could be
called, which trusted to its allies, and to the events that
time and chance might bring forth, would at length exhaust
the hopes and the constancy, as well as the blood,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Schemes for strengthening the government.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the Spaniards. All considerate persons could
not but perceive that the present government
was in no respect more efficient than that of the
Central Junta had been, which, for its inefficiency,
would have been broken up by an insurrection, if it
had not prevented such a catastrophe by a timely abdication.
As a remedy for this evil, the Cortes thought at
one time of taking the executive into their own hands,
and administering it by a committee chosen from their
own members; but the resemblance which this bore to
the system pursued by the French National Convention,
during the worst stage of the revolution, deterred those
who favoured it from bringing forward a proposal that
would reasonably have alarmed the greater part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
assembly, and have disgusted the nation. They who
were of opinion that the Regency would be more effective
if vested in a single person than in three or five, knew
not where that person was to be found who should unite

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cardinal Bourbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

legitimate claims with individual qualifications.
Cardinal Bourbon occurred to them, but as one
who had neither the personal respectability, nor the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Infante D. Carlos.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

capacity desired. The Infante D. Carlos was
supposed to possess sufficient strength of character,
and it was not doubted, that if opportunity of
attempting to escape could be offered him, he would
be not less desirous to avail himself of it than Ferdinand
had, luckily for himself, been found of shrinking from
the danger; but the failure in Ferdinand’s case had
greatly increased both the difficulties and dangers of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Princess of Brazil.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

such an attempt. There remained the princess
of Brazil, whose right to the Regency, under
existing circumstances, was admitted by the
Council of Castille. She had spirit and abilities equal
to the charge; but, on the other hand, she was known to
be of an intriguing and dangerous disposition, ... one
who, being, by reason of her station, sure of impunity in
this world for any thing which she might be inclined to
commit, believed that her father-confessor could at all
times make her equally secure in the next, and was notoriously
disposed to make full use of these convenient
privileges whenever any personal inclination was to be
gratified or any political object to be brought about.
Yet with this knowledge of her character, those British
statesmen who were best acquainted with the affairs of
the Peninsula at that time, and with what advantages we
might carry on the war there, if it were vigorously pursued,
and what were the impediments which in far
greater degree than the entire force of the enemy impeded
our progress, agreed in opinion, that it should be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
the true policy of England to support her claim, regarding
the possible consequences in Portugal, of her appointment
to the Spanish Regency, as a consideration of
inferior moment. There would yet be a difficulty concerning
the place to be fixed on for her residence:
Lisbon it could not be: ... pre-eminently fitted as that
city was to be the capital of the united governments, the
ill-will between the Portugueze and Spaniards, which
the circumstances of the present war unhappily had not
tended to diminish, rendered this impossible; and, for
the same reason, Cadiz was hardly less objectionable.
It was thought, therefore, that the princess might best
reside at Madeira, and govern in Spain through a Vice-Regent.
The conduct of the Cortes in arrogating the
title of Majesty, and exercising, as, in fact they did, the
executive government through successive Regencies,
which they nominated and dissolved at pleasure, made
persons who were otherwise averse to it accede to this
scheme as involving fewer inconveniences than any
other which could be proposed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of the Portugueze government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Some change also, and of the same kind, appeared to
be not less desirable in Portugal. The arrangement
which placed the Portugueze army
under a British general, introducing at the same
time a large proportion of British officers into that army,
and that which placed the whole military establishment
under a British commander-in-chief, had been necessary,
and the Portugueze themselves were sensible that it was
so. But it was not wisely done to put the Portugueze
fleet under a British admiral, nor to make the British
ambassador a member of the Regency: in the first instance,
a great expense was incurred in time of extreme
want; in both, some offence was given to national feeling;
and in neither was there any advantage gained. Sir
Charles Stuart was in no enviable situation; there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
a constant opposition between him and the Souzas, who
had great influence at the court of the Rio, whose intentions
were not to be suspected, and whose abilities were
of no common order, but whose deep prepossessions
prevented them from adapting their views to the actual
circumstances of the country. When he exerted himself
to rectify habitual disorders, and provide for demands
which were continually recurring, and which it was ruinous
to neglect, the whole host of intriguers was in action
against him, and he incurred the dislike of the prince, of
whose ear his opponents had possession: on the other
hand, the repeated complaints from head-quarters against
the misconduct of the Portugueze government under
which the native army was mouldering away more
rapidly than it had been formed, seemed to include him
of course among the persons upon whom the blame was
laid. Yet his colleagues, as well as he, were more to be
pitied than condemned, for what they left undone. The
whole revenues of the house of Braganza were at this
time remitted to Brazil, ... no unfit arrangement, as the
family was there to be supported. But the court received
also the revenues from Madeira and the Western
Isles, and the establishments in Africa, and yet called
for money from Portugal! It had left so great a part of
the old court establishment there that the expenses of
that part exceeded the whole produce of the crown lands;
and it was continually sending persons from Brazil, to
be provided for at home; ... this, at a time when Portugal
with only half its former revenues, and with a
ruined people, had to support an army fourfold more
numerous than in its days of prosperity!</p>

<p>The prince of Brazil was jealous of his prerogative; ...
and there were those about him who lost no opportunity
of insinuating that England aimed at establishing a
permanent influence over the government of Portugal.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
This was so old an art of faction, that even from
new circumstances it could derive no strength; and
although, if he were at Lisbon, he would be within reach
of the insidious proposals of the French, who would
have no difficulty in finding intriguers to second them,
yet, on the whole, those persons whose opinions carried
most weight thought it desirable that he should be
urged to return, his presence nearer Lisbon being as
necessary as that of the princess was deemed to be at
Cadiz. But the statesmen who advised this seem to
have overlooked the circumstances of Brazil, where at
that time the presence of the court was the only check
upon the revolutionary spirit which was then gathering
strength: that consideration alone must have detained
the prince there; and if the claim of the princess had
been more popular than it was at Cadiz, the conduct of
the Portugueze diplomatists on this occasion was sufficient
to ruin it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>M. Wellesley’s views.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Marquis Wellesley, whose views were always comprehensive,
thought that nothing of importance
could be done in the field, unless an efficient
Spanish army were raised of 30 or 40,000 men.
To expect any thing from it under its present establishment,
he argued, would be to deceive ourselves; ... any
thing short of a thorough reform under a British commander
and British officers, Great Britain providing
also for the pay and subsistence of the whole, would be
fruitless; and this we could not afford. But we might
take into our pay an army of 30,000 men, and assist
Spain with a loan of five or six millions for raising
another: a much larger sum would be saved by this
expenditure if it shortened the war a single year; and
that it might be so shortened, no one who had faith in
British courage, and knew the capacity of the British
commander, could doubt. But Marquis Wellesley had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
not that ascendancy in the cabinet to which in the
opinion of his admirers he was entitled, and which,
perhaps, he had expected to assert. His colleagues
might have acted with more vigour, if their tenure of
the government had been more secure; the sense of
that insecurity, and the constant struggle wherein they
were engaged at home, made them regard difficulties as
insuperable, which would have disappeared if they had
had sufficient confidence in themselves.</p>

<p>This want of energy must have been fatal, if Lord
Wellington had not been eminently qualified for the
arduous situation in which he was placed. Both his
mind and body were equal to all that was required from
them. He rose about four, and after a slight breakfast
was usually on horseback from daylight till about the
hour of noon. He was then employed till three, in
transacting business with the officers of the army, or in
writing his orders and letters, answering every dispatch
and letter as it was brought before him. At three he
dined, was on horseback again at five, till evening
closed, and was then employed in business till ten, when
he retired to rest. Mortifying as it was, having in
himself glorious anticipations of what he could effect
with adequate means, at the same time to feel himself
crippled for want of them; no embarrassments ever had
the effect of perplexing his judgment, or leading him to
despond; but making his preparations with long forethought,
he waited the opportunity for attempting whatever
his means allowed him to undertake.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Wellington prepares for the siege of Ciudad Rodrigo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The force with which he intended to besiege Ciudad
Rodrigo consisted of 17,000 British, and 14,000
Portugueze, ... so inferior to what Marmont
might bring into the field against him, that
every thing depended upon secrecy in his
plans, and celerity in their execution. That he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
would undertake the siege was what every officer who
reasoned, or talked about the ensuing campaign, could
not but conclude; but when it was his intention was not
communicated even to those persons in whom he placed
most confidence, and of whom he entertained the<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> highest
opinion. The works of Almeida which Brennier
had demolished, when with so much credit to himself
he abandoned the place, were restored; British and
Portugueze troops in equal numbers being employed
upon them, and receiving working money, and such of
them as were bricklayers or stonemasons, and acted as
artificers, double pay. This, which the French might
consider a defensive measure, was for the purpose of
providing a safe depôt for the battering train. That
train was conveyed up the Douro forty miles, farther
than the boats of the country had navigated the river
before, our engineers having removed the impediments
which rendered it innavigable. There had been such
difficulty in obtaining means of transport, that for this
reason alone, Lord Wellington had been obliged to
undertake feeding all the Portugueze troops that were
incorporated in the British divisions. The system of the
Portugueze commissariat was to embargo carts and
cattle for this service, ... a grievous evil to the owners,
who knew that they were likely never to be paid, and
that their beasts would probably be worked to death;
unless, therefore, they were closely watched, they, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
might be expected, deserted, and left the supplies to
take their chance. Nor, when British faith was pledged
for payment of the commissariat accounts, was there any
perceptible amendment, so long as the means of transport
were to be supplied by the local authorities: these
authorities showed little alacrity in executing the orders
of government, and the people as little in obeying their
requisitions; for the magistrates being delivered from
immediate danger had relapsed into that apathy which
had long pervaded every department of the body politic.
There were 20,000 carts in Alentejo, and yet, when
Lord Wellington was on that frontier, it was with difficulty
that 600 could be procured for the service of the
army. The institutions of the country were excellent;
but government could not enforce the laws, and the magistrates
would not: the British were the only persons
who observed them, and by that observance, subjected
themselves to serious inconvenience; they depended
upon the civil magistrate, who neglected his duty, and
they were then left to shift for themselves. To prevent
this evil, a waggon train was now attached to the British
commissariat, and upwards of 600 carts, each capable
of carrying eight hundred weight, and upon a better
construction than the primitive carts of the country,
were built at Lisbon, Porto, and Almeida. To this latter
place the battering train was conveyed towards the close
of November; and when relying upon Lord Wellington’s
comparative weakness, and the improbability of his attempting
any serious operation at that season, Marmont
had detached Montbrun to the eastern coast, and Dorsenne
had ordered two other divisions to Asturias and
the Montaña: the allied troops began to make fascines
and gabions at their respective head-quarters on the
27th of December; and the 6th of January was fixed
for the investment of Ciudad Rodrigo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1812.<br />January.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The time of year, and the exhausted state of the
country, contributed to deceive the French:
they did not suppose that Lord Wellington
would, in the depth of winter, undertake an operation
of such importance, nor that his army could long endure
the privations to which they must be exposed. Every
thing which could serve for the support of man or beast
had been consumed for miles and miles around; and on
that part of the frontier there was little grain at any
time, the tract for corn commencing at Salamanca and
its neighbourhood, where the enemy were cantoned.
The allied troops were four days together without
bread; and the officers purchased it at the rate of three
shillings the quartern loaf, and at one time five. The
horses, though hardy as if they had never stood in a
stable, and rough as if never groom had laid his hand
upon their coats, began to fail; all the straw having
been consumed, they had nothing to subsist on except
coarse long grass pulled up from under the trees, and so
thoroughly sun-dried that little nourishment was left in
it. Because of this scarcity, the three brigades of cavalry
took the outpost duty in rotation, ... and the regiments
lost about fifty horses each by starvation.</p>

<p>A heavy rain fell on the first night of the new year;
and the weather continued so inclement till the fifth,
that the investment was necessarily deferred till two
days later than the time originally fixed. General Mackinnon’s
brigade marching from Aldea da Ponte to
Robledo, six-and-twenty miles through a continued oak
forest, had in many places to make their way knee-deep
in snow; between 300 and 400 men were left on the
road, of whom some died on the march, several afterwards
of fatigue. There was no camp-equipage with
the army, nor cover near the town; the troops were
therefore cantoned in the nearest villages, and it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
regulated, that the light, first, and third divisions, should
alternately take the duties of the siege, each remaining
four-and-twenty hours on the ground.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ciudad Rodrigo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Ciudad Rodrigo stands in the middle of a plain some
sixteen miles in circumference, surrounded by
hills, which rise gradually, ridge behind ridge
above each other on every side, far as the eye can reach.
From those heights, at a distance of ten or twelve miles,
the movement of the British army might be perceived;
but the enemy seem at this time to have exercised no
vigilance, and voluntary information was never given
them by the Spaniards. The city is on a rising ground,
on the right bank of the Agueda, which in that part of
its course forms many little islets. The citadel standing
on a high mount has been likened, for its situation, to
Windsor Castle. The works were old, and in many
respects faulty; and the suburbs, which are about three
hundred yards from the town on the west, had no other
defence, at the time of the former siege, than a bad
earthen intrenchment hastily thrown up; but the French
had made strong posts of three convents, one in the centre
of the suburbs, and one on either flank; and they had
converted another convent just beyond the glacis on the
north-west angle of the place into an infantry post.
Being thus supported, the works of the suburbs, bad as
they were, were thought fully capable of resisting a

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonel Jones’s Journal of the siege, pp. 82–3.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

<i>coup de main</i>. The ground is every where flat
and rocky except on the north, where there are
two pieces of rising ground, one at the distance
of six hundred yards from the works, being
about thirteen feet higher than the ramparts, the other
at less than a third of that distance, nearly on a level
with them: the soil here is very stony, and in the winter
season water rises at the depth of half a foot below
the surface. The enemy had provided against an attack<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
on this side, by erecting a redoubt upon the higher
ground, which was supported by two guns, and a howitzer
in battery on the fortified convent of S. Francisco
at four hundred yards distance; and a large proportion
of the artillery of the place was in battery to fire upon
the approach from the hill.</p>

<p>On this side, however, it was deemed advisable to
make the attack, because of the difficulty of cutting
trenches in a rocky soil, and the fear of delay in winning
the suburbs, ... the garrison being sure of relief if
they could gain even but a little time. On this side,
too, it was known, by Massena’s attack, that the walls
might be breached at a distance from the glacis; whereas,
on the east and south it was doubtful, because of a fall
in the ground, whether this could be done without erecting
batteries on the glacis: but here a small ravine at
the foot of the glacis and its consequent steepness, would
conceal the workmen during their operations for blowing
in the counterscarp, a circumstance which had great

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonel Jones’s Journal, 84.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

weight in forming the plan of an attack, where
not a single officer had ever seen such an operation
performed.</p>

<p>Time was of such importance, and such preparations
had been made before the army moved from its quarters,
that ground was broken on the very night of the investment.
At nine that night, a detachment under Lieutenant

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>A redoubt carried.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Colbourne of the 52nd attacked the redoubt
on the upper <i>teson</i> or hill. Lieutenant
Thomson (of the Royal engineers) preceded the detachment
with a party of men carrying ladders, fascines,
axes, &amp;c.: he found the palisades to be within three
feet of the counterscarp, and nearly of the same height:
fascines were immediately laid from the one to the other,
by which, as by a bridge, part of the storming party
walked over. When they came to the escarpe, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
was not revêted, the men scrambled up, some of them
sticking their bayonets into the sods, and so entered the
work; while another party went round to the gorge,
where there was no ditch, and forced the gate. Only
four of the garrison escaped into the town, and only
three were killed; two officers and forty-three men were
made prisoners; the loss of the assailants was six men
killed, three officers and sixteen men wounded. A lodgment
was then made on the hill near the redoubt, and
with little loss, because the enemy directed their fire
chiefly into the work; and a communication was opened
to it.</p>

<p>The siege was carried on with extraordinary vigour;
and Lord Wellington calculating upon intelligence which
he received, that Marmont would advance to relieve the
place even before the rapid plan of operations on which
he had determined could be carried through, resolved to
form a breach, if possible, from the first batteries, and
storm the place with the counterscarp entire, if he could
not wait until it should be blown up. The weather
increased the difficulties of the undertaking: while the
frost continued, men could not work through the night;
and when it broke, they who were employed in the sap
worked day and night up to their knees in water, under
the declivity of a hill down which the rain had poured.
Of 250 mules attached to the light division, fifty died in
conveying ammunition to the breaches, ... destroyed by
being overworked, and by want of needful rest and sufficient
food. The garrison were encouraged, not only by
the confident expectation of relief, (for they knew Marmont
was strong enough to effect it, and could not suppose
that, for want of foresight, he had disabled himself
for attempting it in time,) but also by the failure of the
allies at Badajoz, and the inferiority of our engineering
department. They omitted no means of defence, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
neglected no opportunity which presented itself. On
the night, between the 13th and 14th, the convent of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Convent of Santa Cruz taken.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Santa Cruz, in which they kept a strong guard,
was attacked and taken. From the steeple of
the cathedral which commanded the plain, and
where there was always an officer on the look-out, they
noticed a careless custom, that when the division to be
relieved saw the relieving division advancing, the guards
and workmen were withdrawn from the trenches to meet
it; sore weariness and pinching cold were present and
pressing evils, which made them overlook the danger of
leaving the works unguarded at such intervals. Profiting
by this, some 500 men made a sortie at the right
point of time, upset most of the gabions which during
the preceding night had been placed in advance of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">January 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

first parallel, penetrated some of them into the
right of that parallel, and would have pushed
into the batteries and spiked the guns, had it not been for
the steady conduct of a few workmen, whom an officer of
engineers collected into a body; on the approach of
part of the first division, they retired into the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Captain Ross killed.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Captain Ross of the engineers, one of the directors,
was killed by a chain shot from St. Francisco’s:
he was brother to that excellent officer who
afterward fell at Baltimore, and was himself a man of
great professional promise, uniting with military talents,
a suavity of manners, and a gentleness of disposition,
especially to be prized in a profession where humanity
is so greatly needed. His friend and comrade, Lieutenant
Skelton, was killed at the same time, and buried
with him, in the same grave, in a little retired valley,
not far from the spot where they fell. Colonel (then
Captain) Jones, (to whose history of the war, and more
especially, to whose Journal of the Sieges this work is
greatly indebted,) placed a small pedestal with an inscription<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
to mark the grave, and with prudent as well
as christian feeling, surmounted it with a cross. That
humble monument has, because of its christian symbol,
been respected; ... Spaniards have been seen kneeling
there, and none pass it without uncovering their heads.</p>

<p>A howitzer placed in the garden of St. Francisco’s
convent so as to enfilade one of the batteries, had
caused many casualties and impeded the progress of the
work. The convent also looked into the rear of the
second parallel. Two guns which were opened upon
this edifice on the 14th, at the same time that twenty-five
were opened against the walls of the place, did not
drive the enemy from their advantageous post; a
party, therefore, of the 40th regiment was ordered to
force into it at dusk, and as soon as they had escaladed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>St. Francisco’s taken and the suburbs.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the outer wall, the French, leaving their artillery,
retired into the town, not from the convent
only, but from the suburbs, which were immediately
occupied by the 40th.</p>

<p>The batteries had injured the wall so much on the
second day, as to give hopes of speedily bringing it
down. A fog compelled them to cease firing on the 16th;
the engineers took advantage of the cover which the fog
afforded them, and placed fifty gabions in prolongation
of the second parallel. That parallel was pushed to
its proper extent on the left in the course of the night,
and the lower <i>teson</i> crowned by it. The sappers also
broke out the head of the sap: but they could do nothing
on the hill, and but little in the sap, because of their
inexperience, and because the enemy’s artillery knocked
over their gabions, nearly as fast as they could be

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col. Jones’s Journal of Sieges, 102.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

replaced. Yet, the assistance which the engineers
derived from the men of the third division,
who had been instructed in sapping during
the summer, was invaluable, and enabled them to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
push the approaches three hundred yards nearer than
at the attack of Badajoz, under a much heavier fire.
An unusual length of time was nevertheless required
for throwing up the batteries, owing to the small front
of the work, against which the enemy directed an
incessant fire of shell; they fired during the siege 11,000
shells and nearly 10,000 shot upon the approaches:
their practice was remarkably accurate, and not one shot
was fired at them in return. “It was not unfrequent to
have three or four large shells in the course of an hour
explode in the middle of the parapet of a battery, each
having the effect of a small mine, and scattering the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col. Jones’s Journal of Sieges, 103.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

earth in every direction. In consequence of
this dire destruction, the parapets were of
necessity made of a great thickness.” But on the other
hand, a confidence was felt both by the officers and
men, which they had not partaken at either of the former
sieges; the officers had sufficient means at their disposal,
and the men seemed, to perceive that the operations
were differently conducted. The artillery was excellent,
as well as ample in quantity, and its effect was materially
improved by a circumstance in which accident corrected
an actual defect of science. There happened to be a
considerable quantity of shot in the fortress at Almeida,
and of all calibres; when there was such want of transport
for bringing shot from the rear, it became of great
importance to take as many of these as could be made
serviceable: shot of a larger size than what are commonly
employed were thus accidentally brought into use, and
some 2000 or 3000 of what are termed very high shot
were brought forward during the latter days of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir H. Dickson, in Sir Howard Douglas’s Treatise on Naval Gunnery, p. 84.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

siege. The consequence was, that because the
windage was thus diminished, the firing became
so singularly correct, that every shot seemed to
tell on the same part of the wall as the preceding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
one; whereas, when shot of the ordinary size were
fired at the same distance, some struck high and others
low, although the pointing was carefully the same.</p>

<p>On the 17th, a breach had been made, and the guard
in the second parallel kept up a continued fire through
the night, to prevent the garrison from clearing it. At
daylight following, a battery of seven twenty-four
pounders opened upon an old tower; and next day
when this tower had nearly been brought down, and the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 19.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

main breach appeared practicable, Lord Wellington,
after a close reconnoissance, resolved
upon giving the assault at seven o’clock that evening.
The enemy were perfectly prepared; they had constructed
intrenchments on the ramparts near the breach,
by means of cuts through the <i>terre-plein</i>, perpendicular to
the parapet, with a breast-work in rear of them, to
enfilade and rake the whole: so that if the assailants
gained the summit of the breach, their alternative must
be either to force the intrenchments, or get down a wall
sixteen feet in depth, at the bottom of which impediments
of every kind had been arrayed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The place taken by assault.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At dusk the columns of attack were formed, and
they moved forward at the rising of the moon:
150 sappers, under the direction of Captains
M’Leod and Thomson, royal engineers, and
Captain Thompson of the 74th, advanced from the second
parallel to the edge of the ditch, each man carrying two
bags filled with hay, which they threw into the ditch,
reducing its depth thus from nearly fourteen feet to
eight. Major-General Mackinnon followed close with
his brigade, consisting of the 45th, 74th, and 88th, ... the
men jumped into the ditch upon the bags; the enemy,
though not yet wanting in heart, wanted the coolness of
deliberate courage: they had accumulated shells and
combustibles upon the breach, and at the foot of it, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
they fired them too soon, so that the tremendous discharge
was mostly spent before the troops reached their
point of action. Ladders were instantly fixed upon the
bags; they were not sufficient in number, the breach
being wide enough for a hundred men abreast; but the
short delay that this occasioned produced no evil, for
the 5th arrived from the right to take part in the assault,
and their eventual success was facilitated by the speedier
progress of the light division on the left. That division
moved simultaneously with Mackinnon’s column from
behind the convent of St. Francisco against the little

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Craufurd mortally wounded.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

breach, under a heavy fire of musketry from the
ramparts, by which Major-General Craufurd,
who commanded, and was considerably in front,
animating his men and leading them on, was mortally
wounded. The counterscarp here was not so deep, the
breach was not obstinately defended, and no interior
defence had been prepared, so that the assailants carried
it without much difficulty, and began to form on the
ramparts. Meantime Major-General Mackinnon’s brigade,
aided by the 5th, after a short but severe struggle
gained the summit of the great breach. Giving up the
breach, where first one mine was sprung and then a
smaller, though neither with much effect, the enemy
retired behind a retrenchment, where they stood their
ground resolutely, and a severe contest ensued. But
Brigadier-General Pack, who had been ordered with his
brigade to make a false attack upon the southern face of
the fort, converted it into a real one; and his advanced
guard under Major Lynch, following the enemy’s troops
from the advanced works into the <i>fausse braye</i>, made
prisoners of all opposed to them: and while the garrison
was thus disheartened on one side, the success of the
light division on the other took from them all hope as
soon as it was known; they gave way at once, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
retrenchment was carried. The brigade then dividing
to the right and left, General Mackinnon said to Ensign
Beresford, “Come, Beresford, you are a fine lad, we
will go together!” ... these were the last words which
he was heard to utter, for presently some powder
exploded; Beresford was blown up, but fell without
much injury into the arms of Mackinnon’s aide-de-camp

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mackinnon killed.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Captain Call. Mackinnon himself was among
the many brave men killed by the explosion, and
in him the nation lost an officer of the highest promise
in the British army.</p>

<p>The enemy were now driven at the point of the
bayonet into the great square, and were pursued from
house to house, till they threw down their arms and
called for quarter; and this was granted them, in the
first heat of the onslaught, when, as they afterwards
confessed, judging from what they themselves would
have done, they expected nothing else than to be massacred.
The place was won about nine at night: the
troops, British and Portugueze, spread themselves all
over the town, and got at the stores; but fortunately a
guard was placed in time over the spirit-magazine, in
which fifty pipes of good cogniac were found: had the
men got at these, the amount of deaths would have been
increased. It was a scene of wild disorder till daylight.
The night was miserably cold, and the men crowded
into the ruined houses to make fires: these rotten edifices
soon caught the flames, and the conflagration became
dreadful. Very little booty was to be gained in
a town which the French had sacked, and which, indeed,
had been deserted before they occupied it upon their
conquest; what the men found was wholesome as well
as welcome after their late hard fare, and they were
seen each carrying three or four loaves stuck upon his
bayonet. The enemy had pulled down many of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
houses for firewood, and those which were nearest the
ramparts had been demolished by our guns, though
especial care had been taken to spare the town by battering
it only in breach.</p>

<p>The governor, General Banier, was made prisoner,
with seventy-eight officers and 1700 soldiers. Great
quantities of ammunition and stores were found, a well-filled
armoury, and an arsenal abundantly supplied;
109 pieces of ordnance mounted on the ramparts; and
moreover, the battering-train of Marmont’s army, consisting
of forty-four guns with their carriages. The loss
of the allies consisted of three officers and seventy-seven
men killed, twenty-four wounded and 500 during the
siege; six officers and 140 men killed, sixty and 500

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Craufurd.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

wounded, in storming the breaches. Craufurd’s
wound, though severe, was not thought dangerous,
but it proved fatal on the fifth day. He had
entered the army at the age of fifteen, and in the course
of two-and-thirty years few officers had seen so much or
such varied service. Early in life his abilities and professional
zeal were noticed by his then colonel, Sir
Charles Stuart, than whom no man was better qualified
to appreciate them. During peace he pursued the
study of his profession in all its branches upon the continent
for three years, then went to India, and there distinguished
himself in two campaigns under Lord Cornwallis.
He was employed on a military mission with the
Austrian armies during the years 1795, 1796, and 1797,
and again in 1799; was made prisoner in the ill-planned
and not more happily executed expedition against Buenos
Ayres; and afterwards commanded the light division
of Sir John Moore’s army in Spain. With that miserable
retreat his course of ill fortune terminated. He
joined Sir Arthur Wellesley the day after the battle of
Talavera; sustained a severe attack from very superior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
numbers and in a perilous position upon the Coa; signalized
himself at Busaco; rejoined his division after a
short absence, when the troops were drawn up for action
at Fuentes d’Onoro, and was saluted by them with three
cheers in presence of the enemy. “I cannot report his
death,” said Lord Wellington in his dispatch, “without
expressing my sorrow and regret that his Majesty has
been deprived of the services, and I of the assistance of
an officer of tried talents and experience, who was an
ornament to his profession, and was calculated to render
the most important services to his country.” He was
buried with all military honours in the breach before
which he received his mortal wound.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Mackinnon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mackinnon also had been interred in the breach which
he had won; but this was done hastily, by
some pioneers under General Picton’s orders,
and the officers of the Coldstream guards, in which regiment
he had long served, removed his body to Espeja,
and there deposited it with due honours. In Craufurd
the army lost one of its most experienced officers; in
Mackinnon one of the greatest promise, in whom were
united all the personal accomplishments, intellectual
endowments, and moral virtues which in their union
constitute the character of a perfect soldier. He was
one of those men whom the dreadful discipline of war
renders only more considerate for others, more regardless
of themselves, more alive to the sentiments and
duties of humanity. He was born near Winchester in
1773, but his father was chief of a numerous clan in the
Hebrides. His military education was commenced in
France, his family having removed to Dauphiny because
of his elder brother’s state of health; and Buonaparte,
then a military student, was a frequent visitor at
their house. It is one of the redeeming parts of Buonaparte’s
character, that he never forgot his attachment to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
that family; that during the peace of Amiens he invited
them to France, where they might receive proofs of it;
and that when he heard of General Mackinnon’s death,
he manifested some emotion. He entered the army in
his 15th year, served three years as a subaltern in the
43rd, was employed at the commencement of the war in
raising an independent company, and then exchanged
into the Coldstream guards. During the Irish rebellion,
he was attached to the staff as major of brigade to Sir
George Nugent; and distinguishing himself greatly in
that horrible service, was distinguished also for his
humanity. He was in the expedition to the Helder,
volunteered to Egypt, and was at the siege of Copenhagen.
In 1809 he joined the army in Portugal, was
at the passage of the Douro, and had two horses killed
under him at Talavera; how ably he conducted himself
when left in the charge of the wounded after that action
has been related in its proper place. At Busaco he displayed
so much skill and promptitude, that Sir Arthur,
immediately after the battle, returned him thanks in
person. He distinguished himself also on many occasions
during Massena’s retreat, and led that last charge
against the French at Fuentes d’Onoro which drove
them finally from the ground. The unwholesome heat
in the vicinity of Badajoz induced some recurrence of a
disease with which he had been attacked in Egypt, and
he returned for a few weeks to England there to recruit
his health. In 1804 he had married a daughter of Sir
John Call: she planted in his garden a laurel for every
action in which her husband was engaged; and when
in his last visit she took him into the walk where they
were flourishing, he said to her, that she would one day
have to plant a cypress at the end. Perhaps this
country has never sustained so great a loss since the
death of Sir Philip Sidney.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marmont’s movements during the siege.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Without delay the approaches were destroyed and the
works repaired. On the 27th the place had
been again rendered defensible. Marmont was
at Toledo when he received the first tidings of
its investment. Hastening to Valladolid, he stated in
his dispatches to France on the 16th, that he had collected
five divisions for the purpose of throwing supplies
into Ciudad Rodrigo, but finding that force inadequate,
he had been fain to recall two divisions from the army
of the north: with these he should have 60,000 men,
and events might then be looked for as momentous in
their results as they would be glorious for the French
arms. Massena had been a month in reducing that fortress;
the calculation was, that it might hold out against
a regular siege, to which there should be no interruption
from without, four or five-and-twenty days; Marmont
expected to be in good time if he came to its relief on
the 29th; ... but his army was not collected at Salamanca
till the 24th; and when he announced to his own government
the loss of the place, in which he said there
was something so incomprehensible that he would not
allow himself to make any observation upon it, it was
too late to make any movement for its recovery. The
weather, which had so often been unfavourable to the
allies, favoured them on this occasion; heavy rains,
which cut off their communications, and which would
have rendered it impossible to fill in the trenches and
close the breaches, did not commence till four days after
the place had been rendered secure against a sudden
attack; and Marmont, whose battering-train had been
captured with it, could attempt nothing more.</p>

<p>Castaños was present at the siege, and to him as Captain-General
of that province the place was given up.
Before its capture, the Alcaldes of 230 <i>pueblos</i> had repaired
to his head-quarters, to testify their own fidelity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
and that of their respective communities. Lord Wellington
bore testimony in his dispatches as well to the
loyalty and general good-will of the Spaniards in those
parts, as to the assistance he had derived from Brigadier
Alava; and from Julian Sanchez and D. Carlos de
España, who with their two bands had watched the
enemy on the other side the Tormes. A thanksgiving-service
for the reconquest was performed with all solemnity
at Cadiz; and the Cortes, in conformity with
the proposal of the Regency, conferred upon Lord Wellington

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Wellington made Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the rank of a Grandee of the first class,
and the title of Duque de Ciudad Rodrigo.
The tidings could not have been more unexpected
by Buonaparte himself, than it was by
the opponents of administration in England. At the
commencement of the session, they, in their old tone of
dismay, had repeated their denunciations of discomfiture
and utter failure: ministers were again arraigned by
them for their obstinate blindness, ... for their wanton
waste of money and of the public strength, and for persisting
in flattering and fallacious language when they
had brought the nation to the very brink of ruin! Sir

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Speeches of Sir F. Burdett and Mr. Whitbread.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Francis Burdett said, that whatever had been
done by England for the rights of the King of
Spain (who had resigned his whole pretensions
to Buonaparte), nothing had been done for the
Spanish people; that even if the cause of Spain had been
honourably undertaken by the British government, it
had now become perfectly hopeless; our victories were
altogether barren, and the French were making regular
and rapid strides towards the subjugation of the Peninsula:
but these evils, he said, arose from the system of
corruption which an oligarchy of boroughmongers had
established; and as things now were, the progress of
France was more favourable to liberty than the success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
of England would be! With more curious infelicity in
his croakings, Mr. Whitbread observed, that Lord Wellington
after pursuing Massena to the frontiers had been
obliged to fall back; that his attempt upon Ciudad
Rodrigo had proved abortive; that every thing which
we could do for Spain had already been done; and
though the first general of the age and the bravest
troops in the world had been sent to her assistance,
nothing had been accomplished, and, in short, the
French were in military possession of Spain. A month
had not elapsed after the delivery of these opinions,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Vote of thanks to Lord Wellington. He is created an Earl.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

before the thanks of Parliament were voted to
Lord Wellington for the recovery of Ciudad
Rodrigo, he was created an Earl of the United
Kingdom, and an additional annuity of 2000<i>l.</i>
granted to him in consideration of his signal services.
In the course of the debate, Mr. Canning took occasion
to state that a revenue of 5000<i>l.</i> a year had been granted
to Lord Wellington by the Portugueze government when
they conferred upon him the title of Conde de Vimeiro;
that as Captain-General of Spain, 5000<i>l.</i> a year had
been offered him, and 7000<i>l.</i> as Marshal in the Portugueze
service; all which he had declined, saying, he
would receive nothing from Spain and Portugal in their
present state; he had only done his duty to his country,
and to his country alone he would look for reward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations for the siege of Badajoz.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Earl of Wellington was already preparing for a
more arduous siege. Eighteen 24-pounders
had been reserved at Lisbon for this service,
when the battering-train intended for Ciudad
Rodrigo was sent from the Tagus to the Douro. These,
with some iron guns which the Russian fleet had left
there, and with the engineers’ stores, were embarked at
Lisbon in large vessels, as if for some remote destination,
then transhipped at sea into smaller craft, and conveyed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
up the Sadam to Alcacere do Sal. Fascines and gabions
were prepared at Elvas. The line of supply was changed
from the Douro to the Tagus; and as the Beira frontier
must for awhile be left open to the enemy’s incursions,
directions were given for forming a temporary depôt at
Celorico, the nearest point where it could be deemed
safe, and a grand magazine beyond the Douro. Ciudad
Rodrigo was in some degree provisioned, as well as rendered
thoroughly defensible against any attack that the
French had means of making; and the troops were then
put in motion, glad to remove from an exhausted country,
where the labour of procuring forage amounted to constant
occupation for the cavalry, none being to be found
except the straw which the peasants had reserved and
endeavoured to conceal, as the only subsistence left for
their remaining cattle. Corn was so scarce that the
very few officers who could afford such an expenditure
paid the enormous price of fourteen dollars the <i>fanega</i>
for it, in prudence, as well as in mercy to their beasts;
and the owner, loading his horse with his own precious
provender, performed the march himself on foot. One
division of infantry remained on the Agueda, covered by
a few cavalry posts. The main body proceeding by
rapid marches to the Tagus crossed it, some at Abrantes,
some at Villa Velha. Lord Wellington having completed
his arrangements at Ciudad Rodrigo, and given
it finally over to the Spaniards, set out for Alemtejo on
the 5th of March, and on the 11th his head-quarters
were fixed at Elvas. On the 16th, the preparations
being completed, a pontoon bridge was thrown across
the Guadiana about a league below Badajoz; and the
light, 3rd, and 4th divisions, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Barnard, Generals Picton and Colville, crossed and invested
the place without opposition. General Graham,
with the 1st, 6th, and 7th divisions of infantry, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
Generals Slade and Le Marchant’s brigades of cavalry,
advanced to Los Santos, Zafra, and Llerena, to oppose
any movements on the part of Marshal Soult; while
Sir Rowland Hill with the 2nd division, General Hamilton’s
Portugueze division, and a brigade of cavalry,
moved from their cantonments near Alburquerque to
Merida and Almendralejo, thus interposing between
Soult and Marmont, if the latter should march from
Salamanca with the intention of forming a junction as
in the preceding year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations for its defence.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The governor, G. Baron Philippon, had obtained
intelligence from his spies of the preparations
which were making at Elvas, and had apprised
Soult accordingly that there was probably an
intention of again besieging Badajoz; but it was not till
the day before Lord Wellington arrived at Elvas that he
knew a battering-train had been collected there, and that
the allies were concentrating their forces near the Alemtejo
frontier. He had before this applied for a supply
of powder and shells, a convoy of which was twice sent
from Seville, and twice by Sir Rowland Hill’s movements
forced to put back, though the Comte d’Erlon,
General Drouet, had been charged to protect it. The
place had been greatly strengthened since the last unsuccessful
siege, especially on the side which had then
been attacked. Upon the spot where the allies had
planted their breaching-battery against Fort St. Christoval,
a lunette had been constructed by Marshal Soult’s
orders: its ditches were cut in the rock to the depth of
14½ feet below the <i>Berme</i>: a powder-magazine and a
bomb-proof for fifty men had been constructed there,
and every means taken for securing it against a <i>coup-de-main</i>.
The Tête-de-Pont also had been strengthened,
and its communication with Fort St. Christoval repaired,
so that on that side the place presented a most formidable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
appearance. The Pardaleras too had been repaired
and strengthened, and magazines established in
the castle, into which, and into the citadel, it was
the governor’s intention to retire if the place should
be rendered no longer tenable. The enemy had also
formed galleries and trenches at each salient of the
counterscarp in front of what they supposed would be
the point of attack, that they might form mines under
the breaching-batteries, and afterwards sink shafts for
other mines, whereby to destroy the works in proportion
as the assailants should gain them, and thus leave only
a heap of ruins if the place should be taken. No
foresight indeed had been wanting on the governor’s
part. The peasantry having taken flight at the first
siege and left their lands uncultivated, he had given
directions for ploughing them with the oxen which were
intended for slaughter, and they were sown by the
soldiers within a circle of 3,000 yards: the kitchen
gardens had also been distributed among the different
corps and the officers of the staff, and in these they had
a valuable resource. Wood was wanting for blinds and
for palisades, for these had been almost wholly destroyed
during the former siege: they had no means of transport
for it, and it could only have been procured from a
dangerous distance: to make charcoal, they were fain to
dig up the root of olive-trees which had been burnt. A
convoy of some threescore mules laden with flour
arrived a few days before the investment, when the garrison
had about five weeks’ provisions in store. The
miserable townspeople were worse provided: most of
those who could remove without exposing themselves to
extreme distress had left the city before it was first
attacked; others forsook it now, who had experienced
the horrors of two former sieges, ... old men, women, and
children, carrying what little had been left them, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
on the road in every direction, flying from a renewal of
these horrors. The population was reduced from 16,000
to little more than a fourth of that number, who thought
better to abide the worst where they had a place wherein
to lay their heads, than to perish as wanderers.</p>

<p>Though the allied army had now no want of means as
in the former siege, they had no miners, nor was there
any person there who had ever seen such duty performed;
the sappers too had had very little experience.
The only course which could be pursued was to batter
from a distance the Trinidad bastion where the counterguard
in its front had not been finished: this could be
done from the hill on which the Picurina redoubt stands;
and that redoubt must be carried and connected with
the first parallel. The plan was so hazardous, and so
little according to rule, that “it never was for a moment

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Colonel Jones’s Journals, 298.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

approved by any one employed in drawing it
up, or in the execution of it.” No one doubted
its success more than Lord Wellington himself;
but it was deemed necessary to reduce Badajoz, and
there was no chance of reducing it by any other course.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Siege of Badajoz.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the night of the 16th the besiegers broke ground
during a storm of wind, with heavy and uninterrupted
rain. It was so dark that nothing
could be seen by the enemy, and the tempest prevented
them from hearing the working parties, who under these
favourable circumstances were not discovered till daylight,
although only 160 yards from the covered way of
the fort. The ensuing night also was well employed.
The weather continued so rainy that the trenches were
knee-deep in mud and water. Had the soil been heavier,
it would not have been possible to bring up the heavy
artillery; manual assistance, as well as sixteen bullocks,
being required to draw along each piece. It was a
severe service for the three divisions, who had to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
through more than double the work which had occupied
four at Ciudad Rodrigo; and their tents were far from
being proof against such rain. On the 18th the garrison
made a sally with 1500 infantry and forty horse:
they formed unobserved in the communication from the
lunette S. Roque to the Picurina, then pushed forward,
and were in the parallel before the workmen could stand
to their arms; at the same moment the cavalry came
round the right flank of the parallel at a hand gallop,
and were presently in the depôts, a thousand yards in
the rear of the trenches. There they made great confusion
among the unarmed men, but retired on the appearance
of troops before they could destroy any thing.
They took two or three officers prisoners, tied them to
their saddles, and cantered off with them some hundred
yards, but on their falling from fatigue let them go. The
infantry meantime filled in a small part of the parallel
before the coverers came to the relief of the working
parties: they were then driven back in great confusion,
carrying off about 200 intrenching tools. But this sortie
cost the allies about 150 men in killed and wounded;
the commanding engineer, Lieutenant-Colonel Fletcher,
being among the latter.</p>

<p>The weather, which had at first covered the operations
of the allies, continued now so rainy as to impede
them: the trenches were filled with water, and there
was no possibility of draining them, the ground being a
dead level; it was necessary to empty them and make
an artificial bottom of fascines. On the 21st the enemy
advanced two field-pieces on the right of the Guadiana
to enfilade the parallel: such an intention having been
apprehended on the preceding day, the parallel had been
thrown back during the night; these guns, therefore,
did little mischief, and they were compelled to withdraw
them by a few riflemen posted on the banks of the river.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
But on the following night they threw up cover for three
field-pieces there, brought them out soon after daybreak,
and kept up a very destructive fire throughout the day,
their shot pitching into the parallel at a range of 1400
yards. The inconvenience of having left the place open
on that side was then felt, and the 5th division was
ordered from Campo-mayor to invest it. That evening
the trenches were again filled by one of those
showers in which the rain seems rather to pour down in
streams than to fall in drops: the pontoon bridge was
carried away by the rise of the Guadiana, and the current
of that river became so rapid that the flying bridges
could with difficulty work: it became doubtful, therefore,
whether the army could be supplied with provisions,
and whether guns and ammunition could be brought
over for the attack; and it began to be seriously apprehended,
that if the weather continued thus to favour the
enemy the siege must be raised.</p>

<p>An immediate improvement relieved that apprehension:
the trenches were rendered passable during the
night; the morning was fine: it was apparent that
the enemy had mistaken the intended point of attack, for
they had large parties employed in strengthening places
against which nothing was designed: the batteries were
so advanced that there seemed no doubt of their opening
on the morrow, when at three in the afternoon the
skies again began to pour down; every part of the
trenches was again filled with rain: no advance could
be made next day, the ground being so completely saturated
that the water stood everywhere in pools, ... the
earth was too wet to retain any form, the revetements of
the batteries fell, no solid foundation upon which to lay
the platforms could be obtained, and the guns could not
be brought across the fields. But on the following afternoon
the weather became fine; the batteries were completed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
in the course of the night; they opened on the
forenoon of the 25th; and being now secured by a good
parallel, and the batteries enfilading all the faces and
flanks of the place which bore on Fort Picurina, it was
determined to assault that fort that night.</p>

<p>The enemy, as soon as they perceived what point was
immediately threatened, took every means for strengthening
it, and abandoning their works on the right bank
deepened the ditch of the Picurina, and strengthened
the gorge with a second row of palisades: they also
formed galleries communicating with each other, and
brought a reverse fire to flank the ditches. Under the
three angles of the glacis they placed fougasses, and
arranged upon the parapets loaded shells and barrels of
combustibles, which were to be rolled among the assailants
at the moment of assault; and that each man might
have several pieces to discharge, 200 loaded muskets
were ranged along the interior crest of the parapet.
With these preparations the governor calculated upon
a good defence. Six batteries played upon the fort and
the town, and were answered from a greater number of
guns: the Portugueze gunners stood to their cannon with
as much coolness, and directed them with as much precision,
as the British: it was impossible to say whether
the guns of the besiegers or of the besieged were best
served, and this uninterrupted roar of artillery was continued
till sunset with great destruction on both sides.
Captain Mulcaster of the engineers, an officer of great
ability, was killed in the parallel by a cannon-shot.</p>

<p>Major-General Kempt, who commanded in the
trenches, directed the assault of the fort. Two detachments
of 200 men each were formed in the parallel:
both were to quit it at the same time by signal; the one
under Lieutenant Stanway, on the extreme left, to move
round the right flank of the work and endeavour to force<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
the gorge; the other under Lieutenant Gipps, from an
opening about the middle of the parallel, to move direct
upon the communication from the town to the fort, leave
100 men there to prevent succour from being sent, and
with the other hundred to march upon the work with
the twofold purpose, of aiding the left detachment in
forcing the gorge, and of preventing the garrison from
escaping. Another 100 men under Captain Holloway,
R. E., were formed in one of the batteries to assist the
others by a front attack, if they should find much difficulty
in forcing in at the gorge. About ten o’clock the
signal was made: the left party reached the gorge undiscovered;
but when they attempted to cut down and
force over the palisades, so heavy a fire of musketry was
opened upon them that none could effect it. That half
of the right detachment which proceeded to the gorge
was received also with such a fire, that their attempts to
get over the palisade were fruitless: instead of persevering
in the desperate endeavour, they drew round to
the left flank of the work where the ditch was not
flanked, fixed their ladders against the escarpe, and were
presently on the top of the parapet overlooking the
enemy, who defended the rear: at the same moment
Captain Holloway’s party from the battery forced in at
the salient angle, ... but both that officer and Lieutenant
Gipps were wounded. The garrison seeing the assailants
within the works ran into a guard-house, and there
barricadoed themselves: the troops were not prepared
to dislodge them; they had lost their leaders; and while
they were uncertain how to proceed, a report arose that
a large detachment was coming from the town to relieve
the fort. It seemed in their confusion as if they
were on the point of abandoning the place; and the
garrison supposing this to be the case, came out of the
guard-house. But at that critical moment General<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
Kempt by great exertions restored their confidence: they
turned upon the enemy, and of the 300 who composed
the garrison scarcely any escaped. They fought resolutely
to the very last, their officer setting them a brave
example: several threw themselves into the water and
were drowned, about 70 only were made prisoners. The
loss of the assailants was greater: four officers and 50
men were killed, 15 officers and 250 men wounded. It
was found, upon inspecting the fort, that the batteries
had done very little to facilitate its capture; and the engineers
said, that had they been aware how little it was
injured, they would not have recommended the escalade
so soon. The advantage which had been gained was
of great importance; but those successes are dangerous
in their consequences, as well as dearly bought at the
time, in which courage performs what ought to be the
effect of skill.</p>

<p>The enemy, who undervalued the skill of our engineers,
and had such an opinion of British valour that
they thought nothing too rash or too desperate for it to
undertake, supposed that a general assault was intended.
And about the time when the Picurina had been carried,
the alarm-bell rang in the town, rockets were thrown up,
and a random fire of musketry and cannon was opened
from every part of the works. Presently, the alarm of a
sortie was given by a drum beating in the lunette of
S. Roque; the guard of the trenches commenced a
heavy fire, this occasioned a heavier firing from the
town, which again increased that from the trenches,
and it was not till long after midnight that the vain
alarm on both sides subsided. It had not been without
some cause; a battalion had been ordered out to
succour the fort, but so late as to sustain a heavy fire
from it, which compelled them to retire with the loss of
twenty men. A lodgement was then formed on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
<i>terre-plein</i> of the fort, which lodgement was knocked to
pieces in the course of the following day, by a constant
and very heavy fire from the town; but before night the
sappers completed a fresh one. Other batteries were
now constructed, and the enemy then perceiving that
the Trinidad and Santa Maria bastions were the objects
of attack, used all possible means for strengthening them.</p>

<p>The enemy imputed the loss of the Picurina to the
misconduct of its garrison; the captain of artillery had
been wounded in the course of the day, and relieved by
one who was thought not to have shown equal courage:
no use had been made of the loaded shells and combustibles;
but if the fort had been well defended, the
governor thought the allies would have failed, as they
did in their assault during the former siege. A singular
stratagem was now practised by the commanding officer
of the engineers, Colonel Lamarre, which, if accident
had not frustrated it, would have cost the allies dear.
Captain Ellicombe, going at dusk to adjust the lines of
direction of the sap for the night, found those returns
which were already begun, in a good line, clear of
enfilade, but that which was marked by the white line
and not yet commenced, fell in the direct enfilade of
three guns: this he mentioned as a lucky discovery,
and it was supposed to have been the effect of accident,
the line it was thought having, at the time of laying it
down, caught unobserved in the dark against some
stone or bush. But it was afterwards ascertained that a
soldier had been sent out from the place just as evening
closed, to remove it, and bring it directly under fire.</p>

<p>It was against the lunette of S. Roque that these
works were intended; could the enemy be driven thence,
a dam which retained the waters of an inundation might
be broken down, and the works might then be pushed
much nearer to the place. More skill and more courage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
could not have been displayed than were manifested
by the garrison, animated as they were by former success,
and by the expectation of being speedily relieved.
On the other hand, Lord Wellington was not
without cause to apprehend that a second battle of
Albuhera might be to be fought. On the 30th of
March it was understood that Soult was advancing, and
the 5th division was therefore withdrawn from before
St. Christoval and marched to the front, some Portugueze
cavalry being stationed to watch the town on that
side. Two breaching batteries opened next day on the
Trinidad bastion, but these produced no considerable
effect, and the sappers had made little progress against

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

S. Roque’s, when Marshal Soult advanced to
Llerena. It was then intended to leave ten
thousand men for guarding the trenches, and to give
him battle with the remainder of the army: the covering
army was about to fall back on Talavera la Real. But
at noon on the 5th, Lord Wellington reconnoitred the
trenches and thought they might immediately be assaulted:
in the afternoon he determined to defer the
assault till the following day, and meantime endeavour
to break the curtain between the Trinidad counterguard
and an unfinished ravelin. Fourteen guns opened upon

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

this curtain at daylight; in two hours the walls
were brought down, and by four so practicable
a breach, as it appeared, was formed, that the assault
was ordered for ten o’clock that night. The attack was
to be at three points: that of the castle by escalade;
those of the Trinidad and S. Maria bastions by storming
the breaches. The castle was to be assailed by the 3rd
division under Major-General Picton; La Trinidad by
the 4th under Major-General Colville, and Santa Maria
by the left under Lieutenant-Colonel Barnard. At the
same time, S. Roque’s was to be assaulted by a party from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
the trenches, and the 5th division to alarm the enemy
by threatening the Pardaleras and the works towards the
Guadiana.</p>

<p>Meantime the French were indefatigable in preparing
for defence. They imputed it as a gross fault to the
British engineers that they had not destroyed the counterscarps,
an operation which there was no time for performing,
even if it had been possible to perform it
without men more accustomed to such labours than any
in the allied army: but because this had been impossible,
the enemy were enabled to form at the foot of their
counterscarps, and behind the breaches the most formidable
obstructions which destructive ingenuity could
devise. Night and day they were employed in clearing
away the rubbish, destroying the ramps of the covered
way, and making retrenchments behind the trenches.
The fallen parapets were replaced with fascines, sandbags,
and wool-packs; casks filled with tarred straw,
powder, and loaded grenades, were arranged along the
trenches, and large shells with them. Immediately in
front of the breaches at the foot of the counterscarp,
sixty fourteen-inch shells were placed in a circular form,
about four yards apart, and covered with some four
inches of earth, and a communication formed to them
with powder hoses placed between tiles in the manner of
mine-tubes. <i>Chevaux-de-frise</i> were formed of sabre
blades; ... all the artillery stores were turned to account;
even a large boat was lowered into the ditch and filled
with soldiers to flank one of the breaches, where it was
of great use.</p>

<p>An extraordinary circumstance, which might be called
accidental, contributed greatly to the terrible effect of
these formidable preparations. The Spaniards at some
former time intending to have strengthened Badajoz,
had commenced their improvements, as usual with them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
upon a great scale, and, as usual also, left them unfinished.
Thus they had so greatly widened the ditch
as to include within it the covered way and part of the
glacis of the original trace; designing to build a ravelin
to this front, this old glacis and covered way in the space
which was to be occupied by that work were not removed,
and they remained in the ditch like an ill-shapen
rock. The interior of this being the old counterscarp,
the front of it, where it had been cut down to admit of
building the new one, was very steep and difficult of
ascent. The light and 4th divisions, at the hour appointed,
entered the covered way without difficulty;
bags of hay were then thrown down, and ladders placed
down the counterscarp: they descended readily, and
the ditch was presently filled with men. The 4th
division, which was on the right, mistook these old
works in the ditch for the breach, cheered each other
up, and mounted with alacrity; but when they had
reached the summit they found themselves there exposed
to the fire of the whole front, with a difficult
descent before them, the space between them and the
foot of the breaches appearing like a deep ditch; there
were in reality very deep excavations in many parts of
it, sufficiently extensive to prevent an indiscriminate
rush forwards: and water had been introduced along
the counterscarp, by means of which all approach to the
breach either in the face or curtain was precluded, except
by passing over the seeming rock, between which
and the foot of the breach the space was so restricted that
a body of men could advance in only a very small front.
The night was very dark, and this it was felt would
render any confusion irremediable; but confusion presently
arose, for the engineer who led the light division
was killed before he got to the ditch, and being the only
person who knew the way to the breach which they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
to have assaulted, they were directed too much to the
right, and got upon the same summit where the 4th stood
hesitating and perplexed, and thus the confusion was
increased, and both crowded towards the great breach,
instead of taking each its own. They had only five or
six ladders to descend by, which could take only four at
once, and this close under the main force of the garrison,
selected and placed there as at the post of danger,
and most of them having three spare muskets, with
people to load them in the rear as fast as they could be
discharged. The assailants were so thickly crowded on
the glacis and in the ditch, that it was not necessary to
aim at them; but fire-balls were cast among them, which
effected the double mischief of increasing their confusion,
and rendering all their movements as distinctly
visible as if it had been noon-day; the oldest soldiers
declared that they had never before been exposed to so
rapid and murderous a fire. Major-General Colville
fell among the first, severely wounded in the thigh, ... the
last sound which he heard before he fainted was the
voice of Captain Nicholas of the engineers, exhorting
his men in the ditch. That young and excellent officer,
whose charge it was to lead the 4th division to the
breach, after twice essaying to reach the top, fell
wounded by a musket which grazed his knee-pan, a
bayonet thrust in the great muscle of his right leg, his
left arm broken, and his wrist wounded by musket-shot;
... yet, in that state, seeing his old friends and comrades,
Colonel Macleod and Captain James, fall, and hearing
the men ask who should lead them to the third onset,
he rallied, and ordered two of his men to bear him up
in their arms. Two brave fellows attempted this most
perilous service; they had just reached the top when
one of them was killed, and at the same moment,
Nicholas received a musket-ball, which passed through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
the chest, breaking two of his ribs upon the way, upon
which he fell from the top to the bottom of the breach
mortally hurt, and receiving further injury from bruises
in his fall.</p>

<p>Never were brave men exposed to slaughter under
more frightful circumstances. The breach would not
admit of more than fifteen abreast: the assailants repeatedly
reached the summit, though the slope was
covered with planks full of spikes. There they found
the entrance closed with <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> which it was
neither possible to break down nor to cut away, nor to
get over. Many gashed their hands in attempting to
pull them down at the muzzle of the enemy’s muskets,
from which a new species of shot, which the soldiers
called musket-grape, was poured in upon them in one
continuous discharge; ... it consisted of slugs fastened
together, and resembled grape-shot in miniature. Under
this incessant fire, shells, hand-grenades, bags of powder,
and every destructive form of missile or combustible that
ingenuity could invent, were hurled into the ditch.
Gunpowder, it is said, had never, since the hour of its
discovery, been employed with more terrific and terrible
effect. The explosions frequently created a light more
vivid than broad day, which for a moment was succeeded
by utter darkness, ... and then again the whole ground
seemed to be vomiting fire under their feet and every
where around them, while they had no possible means
either of defending themselves or of retaliating. The
officers led their men so close to the enemy’s guns, that
they felt the wadding as well as the ball; when one fell
another took his place; but as it had been impossible
to recover from the first confusion, the men could not be
moved like a machine in collective strength; individual
efforts were all that could be made, and these, though
made with devoted courage, were necessarily vain, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
best and bravest putting themselves forward, and sacrificing
themselves; till at length the troops, knowing it
hopeless to make any farther effort, and yet too high
spirited to retreat, stood patiently in the ditch to be
slaughtered. It was not till more than two hours after
the commencement of this carnage, that Lord Wellington,
being made acquainted with their situation, ordered
these two divisions to be withdrawn and to be formed a
little before daylight for a fresh assault. He might well
indeed conclude, that after the blood which had already
been shed there, success was to be purchased at any
cost; and certainly there would have been much more
chance of success in the second attempt than in the first,
when it might be made in good order, and when the
enemy’s trains had been fired, and their combustible
preparations expended.</p>

<p>This might probably have been his determination, if
no advantage had been obtained in any other part; but
immediately before he gave this order, he received intelligence,
that the 3rd division was in possession of the
castle. Major-General Kempt, who led this attack, was
wounded in crossing the river Rivellas below the inundation,
a fire having been opened upon them from the
whole of the eastern works, as soon as they reached that
stream. It was General Philippon’s intention, if the
breaches should be forced, to retire into the castle,
which had the strength of a citadel: with this and the
<i>tête-du-pont</i>, and Fort Christoval, he might yet have
held out some days, and give time thereby for those
movements which he supposed would again be made for
his relief. With this view he had strengthened and
stored it; all its gates had been built up, and the ramparts
were covered with large Spanish shells, stones,
beams, and whatever could be thrown upon the heads of
the assailants. By means of these preparations, a most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
obstinate resistance was opposed to the escalade, and for
a considerable time all who attempted to rear the ladders
were destroyed. At length an entrance was forced up
one ladder at an embrasure; the defence immediately
slackened, and other ladders were quickly reared, with
that alacrity which the feeling of success inspires. An
officer of the German Legion, Girsewald by name, who
was remarkable for his bodily strength, was one of the
first who mounted. A French soldier fired at and missed
him, then made a thrust with the bayonet; Girsewald,
with his left hand, parried the bayonet and seized it, and
held it so firmly, that the exertions which the Frenchman
made for recovering his weapon, assisted him in mounting,
till he got high enough to aim a blow in his turn,
with which he severed his antagonist’s head from his
shoulders. A false report having been made to Philippon
that one of the bastions had been entered by the
assailants, the falsehood of that intelligence made him
doubt and hesitate when he heard they were escalading
the castle. Two companies which he intended to order
thither, by some mistake either in giving or understanding
the order, went to the breaches instead, where they
were not wanted; and four others, which took the right
direction, arrived too late: the castle had been taken;
they were received by a heavy fire of musketry, and
dispersed with loss. One of the last shots which were
fired struck Girsewald on the knee; he would not let
the limb be amputated, and therefore the wound proved
fatal.</p>

<p>The 5th division were not less successful, though the
party with the scaling ladders lost their way, and Lieutenant-General
Leith could not, in consequence, move
till it was after eleven o’clock. The bastion of S.
Vicente which he attacked was fully prepared for defence,
and the troops were discovered when on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
glacis; yet they forced in by escalade. Major-General
Walker then advanced along the ramparts to fall on the
rear of the enemy who were defending the breaches;
the troops, when driving the French before them, were
opposed by a single field-piece placed on the <i>terre-plein</i>
of the curtain; the gunner lighted a port fire as they
approached: at the sudden blaze of light, one who was
among the foremost in pursuit cried out “A mine!”
That fearful word ran through the line of pursuers; the
very men who had so bravely won the bastion, as if
their nature had been suddenly changed, took panic,
and in spite of their general’s efforts, who was severely
wounded while endeavouring to rally them, were driven
back by the bayonet to the place whereat they had
entered: but by this time the reserve had formed there,
the pursuers in their turn were checked, and the British
marched immediately to the breaches, from which the
defenders then dispersed, seeing that all was lost. This
attack might have been spared if any signals had been
agreed upon by which Picton’s success should have
been made known; for want of such concertment, General
Leith’s attack was made after the escalade had
succeeded; he met with the same opposition as if the
fate of the place had not been decided in another quarter,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col. Jones’s Sieges, 303.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and thus Badajoz may be said to have been
twice carried that night. Philippon with his
staff retired into Fort Christoval, and surrendered in the
morning.</p>

<p>The place was plundered during the remainder of the
night and on the following day, nor could order be restored
till the day afterwards. The doors were forced
by firing through the locks, and most of the inhabitants
had placed a table immediately in the entrance of their
houses, with a candle and a bottle of brandy, supposing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
that this would content the soldiers: the consequence
was that, excited as they already were, they became half
mad with the fiery spirit. But whatever excesses they
committed, their excitement took the form of good fellowship
toward their defeated enemies; and they were seen
walking about with the French soldiers, arm in arm,
inviting them to drink, and taking every care of them.
As soon as fresh troops could be brought up from the
corps of observation, they were marched in, and order
was then restored. 59 officers and 744 men were killed
on the night of the assault; 258 officers wounded and
2600 men; the total number of killed and wounded
during the siege was 5000. The garrison consisted of
nearly 5000, of whom about 3500 were made prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Soult advances to relieve the place, ... and retreats.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On this occasion the French Marshals had been less
alert than during the former siege, and they had
not acted so well in concert. Marshal Soult
left Seville on the 1st, with all the force he
could collect. On the 4th he reached Llerena;
and having arrived at Villa-Franca, two marches only
from Badajoz, on the 8th, he there learned that the city
had been taken on the night of the 6th. The inhabitants
reported, that his chagrin at this intelligence was
manifested in fits of intemperate anger, and that he
broke nearly all the plates and dishes within his reach.
Before daylight he commenced his retreat; the allied
cavalry immediately followed his march, and on the
11th, attacked his rear guard (consisting of General
Drouet’s cavalry, 2500 in number) at Usagre, and drove
them to Llerena, killing many, and bringing away about
150 prisoners, and nearly as many horses. It was believed
throughout this part of the country, that Ballasteros
had entered Seville; and the people giving, with
their characteristic credulity, implicit belief to the idle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
rumour, made rejoicings everywhere for the supposed
success, and seemed wholly to disregard the recapture
of Badajoz.</p>

<p>If Ciudad Rodrigo had been provisioned at this time
as it ought to, and as Lord Wellington expected it would
have been, his intention was immediately after the
capture of Badajoz to have advanced upon Seville with
40,000 men; that movement would instantly have raised
the siege of Cadiz, and Soult might probably have been
obliged to withdraw from Andalusia, and take up a
defensive position on the Tagus. But the British Commander’s
operations were still crippled by the insufficiency
of his means; the Spaniards were not to be relied
on for any exertions, however necessary, for their own
deliverance; the Portugueze were paralysed by the
poverty to which the government and the nation were
reduced; and the British ministry were not yet sufficiently
encouraged by success and by popular opinion,
to increase their efforts and therewith an expenditure

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marmont enters Beira.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

already unexampled in amount. Marshal Marmont,
meantime, supposing that Soult would be
able to raise the siege of Badajoz, thought the
opportunity favourable for an attempt upon the Beira
frontier. Lord Wellington had foreseen this, and had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrangement for the defence of that frontier.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

little means of providing against it. Relying,
however, upon the officers whom he had left in
command at Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida, for
all that could be done by vigilance and sound
judgment, he had directed General Bacellar to collect
the Portugueze militia corps and march thither, ...
Sylveira to protect the Tras-os-Montes, and Brigadier-Generals
Sir Nicholas Trant and Sir John Wilson to
cover that part of Beira extending from the Douro along
the Coa to Sabugal, with especial orders to look to the
safety of a considerable magazine of ammunition at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
Celorico. Bacellar fixed his head-quarters at Lamego;
the two Anglo-Portugueze Brigadiers had about 3500
men, but only a single squadron of dragoons between
them, and but a small proportion of the men had served
with them in the former campaigns. In Portugal, the
militia is a service in which no man willingly either
enters or continues, for they receive only half the pay of
the regular soldier, and half the ration of provisions,
and are clothed at their own expense. This body is composed
wholly of married men, or of widowers having
children, these being the only persons exempted from
the conscription: such men were naturally anxious and
desirous of returning home, whenever, by means of
favour or of corruption, they could obtain leave; in the
interval of the campaign, their places were supplied by
others of the same class; two-thirds at least of the whole
number consisted of such raw recruits, and the others
had not been exercised one day since they were disbanded
in the spring of the preceding year.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marmont deterred by a feint from assaulting Almeida.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Marmont did not know how weak a force could be
brought into the field rather to observe his
movements than to oppose them; but he knew
that Ciudad Rodrigo was ill-stored with provisions,
and that the injury which Brennier had
done to the fortifications of Almeida when he abandoned
that place had been insufficiently repaired. Advancing,
therefore, from Salamanca with about 20,000 men,
including 1200 cavalry, he summoned Ciudad Rodrigo:
the Spaniards had made so little progress in repairing
the works, that he might probably have carried it by
escalade; but the French had now lost something of
their confidence; he was afraid of committing himself,
and leaving one division to blockade it, proceeded with
the rest of his army towards Almeida. Colonel Le
Mesurier commanded in that fortress, and its safety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
depended much more upon the character of its commander
than upon its own strength or that of the
garrison, which consisted entirely of militia. Trant,
arriving with his division upon the Coa just at this time,
and receiving intelligence there of the enemy’s movements,
proceeded without delay to occupy the position
of the Cabeço Negro, which Lord Wellington had
occupied during Massena’s operations against Almeida:
the French were already arriving before that place, and
it was with difficulty that a corps of between 7 and 800
Spaniards under D. Carlos d’España escaped their close
pursuit and effected a junction with this body of Portugueze.
It was of great consequence to communicate
with Colonel Le Mesurier now. Trant, though exposed
to the fire of the French advanced posts, effected this,
and during a short interview, they agreed upon the
course to be pursued in case Almeida should be
seriously threatened; and also, that during the night an
attempt should be made to impose upon the French by
making show as of a considerable force upon the left
bank of the Coa. Accordingly, fires were kindled to
the right and left of the position; and the enemy,
deceived by this easy stratagem into a belief that a corps
of British troops was present, gave up their intention of
assaulting the fortress; they only threw forward a reconnoitring
party upon the glacis, which the Governor
drove back with loss.</p>

<p>Had Marmont assaulted the place, he might probably
have captured it, and would have found there a battering-train,
which would have enabled him to break
ground before Ciudad Rodrigo. On the following morning
he withdrew, and leaving Almeida in the rear proceeded
to Sabugal, where he established his head-quarters:
it was now at his option either to advance upon the
Tagus by Castello Branco, or by Guarda upon the Mondego<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
and Celorico; but his operations had neither been

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Advance of the French to Castello Branco and their retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

well concerted, nor were they vigorously pursued. His
advanced guard followed the first hussars, who
had been left under Major-General Alten in
front of Ciudad Rodrigo, through Lower Beira,
but at a distance; and they entered Castello
Branco, that officer having fallen back thither, and retiring
from thence before them with Brigadier-General
Le Cor’s brigade of militia which had been stationed
there. The hospital and the stores were removed beyond
the Tagus. The enemy did not cross the river in
pursuit, and when Alten and Le Cor recrossed, the
French retreated, evacuating the city two days after
they had taken possession of it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marmont attempts to surprise the Portugueze at Guarda.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meantime Bacellar, who had removed his head-quarters
to Celorico, instructed Trant and Wilson to
occupy Guarda, relying upon Dumouriez’ erroneous
opinion of the advantages of a position
which Lord Wellington afterwards pronounced
to be the most treacherous one in Portugal. They,
though they were not at that time aware of the defects
of the ground which they were ordered to take, would far
rather have moved behind the Mondego, from whence
the magazines at Celorico might have been better protected.
The French were dispersed over a large extent
of country for the purpose of procuring provisions, and
for plunder; but Marmont, having collected about
10,000 of his men and half his cavalry, on the evening
of the day on which his advanced guard retired from
Castello Branco, advanced upon Guarda, expecting to
surprise the Portugueze divisions there. A hundred
men under a Captain and two Lieutenants had been stationed
about half a mile in front of the town, on the
Sabugal road. Marmont himself advancing with 500
cavalry, surprised and captured the out-piquet of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
party, and pushed on within 200 yards of the city, but
hearing the drums beat to arms, and being unsupported
by infantry, he thought it prudent to fall back upon his
main force. The Portugueze, who at that moment could
have offered little resistance even to a less formidable
enemy, soon drew up on the outside of the town, towards
the danger; it was just at daybreak, and they ascertained
the great superiority of the French in time to
commence their retreat. Guarda being untenable, and
the troops having only rations for the present day, and
depending upon Celorico for supplies which would now
be cut off, Trant, therefore, in concurrence with Wilson’s
opinion, resolved to retire behind the Mondego,
which was about six miles distant. Two battalions
were continued in position, while the remainder retired
through the town, and took up ground in its rear unobserved
by the enemy; but no sooner were the whole set
in motion than the French cavalry followed, threatening
to charge the columns. The ground for about five
miles was entirely open; but a regiment was successively
halted in echelle for the protection of the troops
in march, and by this means the movement went on in
perfect order, till the moment when all danger seemed to
be at an end.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Flight of the Portugueze militia by the Mondego.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Immediately before the road to Celorico reaches the
Mondego, it descends a sloping ground, much
broken and covered with wood. The enemy’s
horse was by this time pressing them close;
Trant, therefore, halted his rear-guard of one
battalion within the wood, about a hundred yards from
the summit of the hill, where they could not be attacked
by cavalry, and where by making a stand, they might
have gained time for the rest of the troops to ford the
river and form on the opposite side. But it had not ceased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
raining for some hours, and when they were ordered to
fire upon some of the French who dismounted, and were
firing their carabines upon them, very few of the firelocks
went off; the men instantly lost confidence, and
every one thought to escape unnoticed by favour of the
ground. Trant presently found himself with not more
than a hundred men besides the officers of his staff and
of the regiment. The panic which these fugitives spread
was increased by the small party of Portugueze cavalry,
which having been employed thus far in watching the
enemy, retreated with too much precipitation through
the rear-guard, glad to find themselves in comparative
safety among the trees; and some of them escaping to
the main body, it was supposed from their report that
the whole of the rear-guard had been cut off. All efforts
of the officers were in vain; they took to flight; the
enemy’s cavalry descended the hill unopposed, and
made about two hundred prisoners without killing
or wounding a single man. Five colours were lost in
this rout, the bearers having either hid them in the
wood, or thrown them into the Mondego; and a few
men were drowned in hurrying over the river. Some of
the fugitives hastened to Celorico, declaring that the
enemy were in full pursuit, and continuing their flight,
they spread the same report all the way to Coimbra. It
had this ill effect at Celorico that the officer in charge of
the depôt there set it on fire, concluding hastily, that what
these persons reported as eye-witnesses, must to its

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Marmont retreats.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

whole extent be true. But night had closed
opportunely for the Portugueze; their officers
succeeded in rallying them beyond the river, and the
French did not attempt to pass, waiting till the morning:
during the night Marmont received unwelcome tidings
that Badajoz had fallen, and that Lord Wellington was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
on his way to the north; he therefore retraced his steps
towards Sabugal, concentrated his army there, and then
commenced his retreat upon Salamanca, raising the
blockade of Ciudad Rodrigo. The enemy in this expedition
had robbed and murdered the inhabitants as usual;
but they derived no advantage from it whatever, having
attempted more than they could execute, and leaving
unattempted what they might have achieved.</p>

<p>Marshal Beresford noticed the conduct of the militia
in the severest terms; and it is worthy of remark, that
the order which contained this censure found its way
into the Moniteur, ... of so much consequence was it
deemed at Paris to depreciate the Portugueze soldiers
now when the French had begun to find them formidable.
An <i>alferes</i> and two serjeants were brought to
trial at Coimbra, for cowardice, and for spreading fearful
and false reports upon their flight: they were condemned
to death and executed. The Porto militia
regiment in which the panic had begun was deprived
of its colours till it should recover its character in the
presence of the enemy; two other regiments which had
lost theirs were not to have them restored till, in like
manner, they had effaced the stain of their late conduct;
and the Penafiel militia, which had lost one and preserved
the other, was ordered to deposit that other with
the <i>Camara</i> of their town till they should have approved
themselves worthy to be intrusted with it again. As
this was the only instance in which the Portugueze
had disgraced themselves since their military establishment
had been reformed, it was treated with the greatest
severity.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Wellington retires to Beira.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lord Wellington, as soon as he heard of Soult’s retreat,
had put his army in motion toward the
Beira frontier. He established his head-quarters
at Fuente Guinaldo; the troops were cantoned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
between the Agueda and the Coa; and though
the magazines at Celorico had been destroyed, those
beyond the Douro sufficed for their supply. Here, therefore,
they rested awhile to recruit their strength. Their
means of transport were employed in provisioning Badajoz,
and Lord Wellington prepared to follow up the brilliant
successes of the campaign.</p>

the war. Early in the year Marquis Wellesley
resigned the seals of his office: he could not
prevail upon his colleagues in the cabinet to
place such means at the disposal of Lord Wellington as
might enable him to follow up his advantages with every
human certainty of complete success; and he was impatient
of continuing in a subordinate station to Mr.
Perceval, whom he seems to have estimated far below

Earl of Liverpool’s hands till a successor should be appointed.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Restrictions on the Regency expire.<br /><span class="date">Feb. 13.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

At this time the restrictions on the
Regency were about to expire, and the Prince
addressed a letter to his brother the Duke of
York, saying how much it would gratify him if
some of those persons with whom the habits of his
public life had been formed would strengthen his hands
and constitute a part of his government; and authorizing
him to communicate his wishes to Lord Grey, who
would make them known to Lord Grenville. “The
national faith,” said the Prince, “has been preserved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
inviolate towards our allies; and if character is strength,
as applied to a nation, the increased and increasing reputation
of his Majesty’s arms will show to the nations
of the continent how much they may still achieve when
animated by a glorious spirit of resistance to a foreign
yoke. In the critical situation of the war in the Peninsula,
I shall be most anxious to avoid any measure
which can lead my allies to suppose that I mean to
depart from the present system. Perseverance alone
can achieve the great object in question; and I cannot
withhold my approbation from those who have honourably
distinguished themselves in the support of it. I have
no predilections to indulge, ... no resentments to gratify,
... no objects to attain but such as are common to the
whole empire.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Communication from the Prince to the leaders of Opposition.<br /><span class="date">January 7.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was not likely that this communication to the two
joint leaders of the Opposition would bring them
to act in concert with Mr. Perceval, whom
having tried and proved, the Prince would not
now have abandoned. Earl Grey had said in
the debate on the address, “he should feel unhappy
if he departed from that House without declaring
that he retained all the opinions which he before held on
subjects of great magnitude, ... opinions confirmed by
experience and the evidence of facts, ... opinions which
he should ever be ready to maintain and defend, the
system that had been adopted having been, in fact, the
source of almost all our present and impending calamities.”
Lord Grenville’s language on the same occasion
had been to the same purport: “The framers of the
Prince Regent’s speech,” he said, “were the very men
who by their obstinate blindness had brought the
country to the brink of ruin, and who, in the midst of
the distresses they themselves had occasioned, still held
the same flattering and fallacious language. He would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
protest against a continuance of those measures which
had brought such calamities on the country, ... calamities
so real and momentous, that they must soon press themselves
with irresistible force on their lordships’ attention,
whether or not they were willing to give them the consideration
they deserved. People might choose to close
their eyes, but the force of truth must dispel the wilful
blindness; they might choose to shut their ears, but the
voice of a suffering nation must sooner or later be heard.
He still retained his objections to every part of the
system which he had so often condemned; he still
deprecated that wanton waste of money and of all the
public resources, when it was more necessary than ever
to husband them with the most provident care.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reply of Lords Grey and Grenville.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The two lords framed their reply to the Duke of York’s
communication in conformity with these declared
opinions: “No sacrifice,” they said, “except
those of honour and duty, could appear to us too
great to be made, for the purpose of healing the divisions
of our country, and uniting both its government
and its people. All personal exclusion we entirely disclaim;
we rest on public measures; and it is on this
ground alone that we must express, without reserve, the
impossibility of our uniting with the present government.
Our differences of opinion are too many and too
important to admit of such an union: ... they embrace
almost all the leading features of the present policy of
the empire.” Then touching upon the state of Ireland,
“We are firmly persuaded,” they said, “of the necessity
of a total change in the present system of government in
that country.”</p>

<p>The great body of the nation dreaded at this time
nothing so much as any change in the ministry which
would bring the despondents into office; they therefore
regarded this refusal of the Prince Regent’s overture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
with the greatest satisfaction; but it gave offence to
others of that party, who looked upon themselves with
some reason as having been included in the overtures,
and were of opinion that they ought to have been consulted
before such an answer was returned; there might
have been a distribution of loaves and fishes; and
though the two lords were not hungry, they were: ... this

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">March.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the public learned from their complaints. The
seals of the foreign department were now accepted
by Lord Castlereagh, who while out of office,
instead of entering into opposition, had supported the
measures of a cabinet whose general course of policy he
approved, and in whom the ministry, if they gained little
accession of strength in public opinion, obtained an
active and useful colleague, on whose intrepidity and
honour and straightforward integrity they could rely.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Boringdon’s motion.<br /><span class="date">Mar. 19.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lord Boringdon, however, thought proper to move in
the House of Lords for an address to the Prince
Regent, requesting that he would endeavour to
form a cabinet which might effectually call
forth the resources of the empire. “The motion was
founded,” he said, “on his deep sense of the alarming
evils which threatened the safety of the nation, and on
the imperative necessity of obtaining an efficient administration
capable of averting them; ... for the darkest
and most gloomy prospects now surrounded us; dangers
were pressing upon us on every side, and at this same
time the means of averting them were weakened.” The
Catholic question was largely introduced in the ensuing
debate; a party in Parliament using that question as a
means for harassing the administration, while men of
worse intentions but far greater foresight employed it as
an engine by which they expected to separate Ireland
from England, eradicate the Protestant Church in one
country, and finally subvert the constitution of the other.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
But the public looked with much more interest to the
opinions concerning the war expressed by those who,
notwithstanding their late refusal of office, were supposed
to be expectant of it; and upon this point Earl
Grey’s sentiments seemed to have undergone some
modification. “Certainly,” he said, “he was not prepared
to affirm that it was expedient to recall our troops
immediately home, but certainly he did not wish to proceed
in that expensive mode of warfare without having
some military authority as to the result of it. He

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Speech of Earl Grey.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

thought, and most decidedly, that a reduction
of our expenditure was called for by reflections
of the most urgent and powerful kind, ... but if any thing
like a certainty of success could be shown in the schemes
that were devised, then all his hesitations would be
removed, and he should consider even the most extensive
scale of foreign operations as recommended by the
principles of economy itself. He felt warmly the justice
of that cause which we were maintaining in the Peninsula.
No cause related in the annals of mankind ever
rested more entirely on sentiments of the most honourable
feeling, or was more connected (if circumstances
were favourable) with principles of national advantage.
The spectacle exhibited was the most interesting that
could engage the sympathies or the attention of the
world; and it was impossible not to wish to afford assistance
to the noble struggle of a free people, against the
most unparalleled treachery, the most atrocious violence,
that ever stained or degraded the ambition of despotic
power. But those principles upon which the prosecution
of that war could be defended must be reduced to a
mere speculative theory, unless supported by adequate
exertions from the Spanish people and the Spanish
government. Without that necessary co-operation, all
our efforts must prove useless. The success of our arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
during the last two years had been called complete: he
could coincide in no such declaration, knowing, as every
other man knew, that the defence of Portugal must be
impracticable after Spain should be entirely subdued.
We had unquestionably achieved much, and in the
capture of Cuidad Rodrigo he concurred in the admiration
justly due to the great commander who conducted
that important enterprise. But when he looked to
another part of that kingdom, and saw Badajoz in
possession of the enemy, ... when he looked to Catalonia,
Valencia, Murcia, ... he was at a loss to discover what
new prospects of success had dawned upon the Spaniards.
Those conquests opened to the enemy a free
communication between all their divisions, and they
would soon be enabled by that circumstance to bring the
whole weight of their united forces against the British.
He did think, too, that ministers had been culpably
negligent in not having exerted in that quarter the
means actually in their power, by employing a considerable
naval force for the purpose of lending our allies
more effectual succour. Such a system, if properly conducted,
would in all probability have enabled the
Catalans to expel their invaders. Where then were the
symptoms of this boasted success? Lord Wellington, at
the head of 62,000 as effective men as were ever led
into the field, had been compelled to remain on the
defensive! With a force greater than that commanded
by the Duke of Marlborough at the most splendid era
of our military history, Lord Wellington had found
himself limited to the pursuit of a defensive system!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Overture from the French government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lord Boringdon’s motion met with little support, and
the tidings of Lord Wellington’s success at Badajoz
contributed to confirm the confidence
which the great majority of the public felt in
the existing administration. The fall of that fortress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
was so decisive a proof of British enterprise and courage,
that Buonaparte would not allow it to be mentioned in
the French newspapers; and under his vigilant despotism
the French people could know nothing more of
public affairs than he thought proper to communicate.
At this time he was preparing for an expedition upon
a greater scale than any which he had before undertaken,
and to a greater distance than he had yet advanced
in his career of conquest. An overture for peace
to the British Government, upon grounds which he knew
to be inadmissible, served now, as on former occasions,
for a prelude to this new drama of his ambition. “His
Majesty the Emperor,” the Duc de Bassano said in a

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">April 17.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

communication to Lord Castlereagh, “being
constantly actuated by sentiments friendly to
moderation and peace, and moved by the awful circumstances
in which the world is at present placed, is
pleased again to make a solemn and sincere attempt for
putting an end to the miseries of war. Many changes
have taken place in Europe during the last ten years,
which have been the necessary consequence of the war
between France and England, and many more changes
will be effected by the same cause. The particular
character which the war has assumed may add to the
extent and duration of these results. Exclusive and
arbitrary principles cannot be combated but by an opposition
without measure or end; and the system of preservation
and resistance must have the same character of
universality, perseverance, and vigour. This might have
been prevented if the peace of Amiens had been observed.”
Having referred then to the overtures which
Buonaparte had made in the years 1805, 1808 and 1810,
the French minister proceeded thus: ... “I will express
myself, Sir, in a manner which your excellency will find
conformable to the sincerity of the step that I am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
authorized to take; and nothing will better evince the
sincerity and sublimity of it than the precise terms of the
language which I have been instructed to use. What
motives should induce me to envelope myself in formalities
suitable to weakness, which alone can find its
interest in deceit?... The affairs of the Peninsula and of
the Two Sicilies are the points of difference which
appear least to admit of being adjusted.... I am authorized
to propose an arrangement of them on the following
basis: ... The integrity of Spain shall be guaranteed.
France shall renounce all intention of extending her
dominions beyond the Pyrenees. The present dynasty
shall be declared independent, and Spain shall be
governed by a national constitution of her Cortes. The
independence and integrity of Portugal shall also be
guaranteed, and the house of Braganza shall have the
sovereign authority. The kingdom of Naples shall
remain in possession of the present monarch, and the
kingdom of Sicily shall be guaranteed to the present
family of Sicily. As a consequence of these stipulations,
Spain, Portugal and Sicily shall be evacuated by
the French and English land and naval forces. With
respect to the other subjects of discussion, they may be
negotiated upon this basis, that each power shall retain
that of which the other could not deprive it by war.
Such, Sir, are the grounds of conciliation offered by his
Majesty to his Royal Highness the Prince Regent. His
Majesty, the Emperor and King, in taking this step, does
not look either to the advantages or losses which this
empire may derive from the war, if it should be prolonged:
he is influenced simply by considerations of
the interests of humanity, and the peace of his people.
And if this fourth attempt, like those which have preceded
it, should not be attended with success, France
will at least have the consolation of thinking that whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
blood may yet flow, will be justly imputable to
England alone.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Castlereagh’s reply.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This overture was answered as it deserved; Lord
Castlereagh was instructed, before he entered
into any explanations, to ascertain the precise
meaning attached by the French Government to
its proposal concerning the actual dynasty and government
of Spain. “If,” said he, “as His Royal Highness
fears, the meaning of this proposition is, that the royal
authority of Spain and the government established by the
Cortes shall be recognised as residing in the brother
of the head of the French Government, and the Cortes
formed under his authority, not in the legitimate sovereign
Ferdinand VII., and his heirs, and the extraordinary
assembly of the Cortes, now invested with the
power of the government in that kingdom, in his name
and by his authority, I am commanded frankly and
explicitly to declare, that the obligations of good faith
do not permit His Royal Highness to receive a proposition
for peace founded on such a basis. But if the
expressions apply to the actual government of Spain,
which exercises the sovereign authority in the name of
Ferdinand VII., upon an assurance of your Excellency
to that effect, the Prince Regent will feel himself disposed
to enter into a full explanation upon the basis
which has been transmitted; it being his most earnest
wish to contribute, in concert with his allies, to the
repose of Europe; and to bring about a peace which may
be at once honourable not only for Great Britain and
France, but also for those states which are in amity with
each of these powers. Having made known, without
reserve, the sentiments of the Prince Regent with respect
to a point on which it is necessary to have a full
understanding previous to any ulterior discussion, I shall
adhere to the instructions of his Royal Highness, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
avoiding all superfluous comment and recriminations on
the accessary objects of your letter. I might, advantageously
for the justification of the conduct observed by
Great Britain at the different periods alluded to by your
Excellency, refer to the correspondence which then took
place, and to the judgment which the world has long
since formed of it. As to the particular character the
war has unhappily assumed, and the arbitrary principles
which your Excellency conceives to have marked its progress,
denying as I do, that these evils are attributable
to the British Government, I at the same time can
assure your Excellency, that it sincerely deplores their
existence, as uselessly aggravating the calamities of
war; and that its most anxious desire, whether at peace
or at war with France, is to have the relations of the
two countries restored to the liberal principles usually
acted upon in former times.”</p>

<p>No answer was attempted to this unanswerable reply;
and the signal success of the British arms since the
commencement of the year had so far raised the public
spirit, that no attempt was made in Parliament to
ground upon the failure of these overtures any accusation
against the ministers for wantonly prolonging the war.
With a great majority in both Houses, and a still greater
in the nation, with the confidence also of the Prince
Regent, which was now no longer doubtful, the administration
seemed, for the first time since the king’s

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Perceval murdered.<br /><span class="date">May 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

malady, to be firmly established, when Mr.
Perceval was shot through the heart, in the
lobby of the House of Commons, by a madman.
The murderer was a person who, having failed in some
mercantile speculations at Archangel, and having been
thrown into prison there, imagined himself wronged by
the Russian Government, and by the British Government,
because it had not taken up his cause, concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
which he had molested both governments, with repeated
and groundless memorials; for the business was entirely
of a private nature, in which they could not interfere.
He made no attempt to escape. “My name,” he said,
“is Bellingham; it is a private injury; it was a denial
of justice on the part of government. I know what I
have done. They have driven me to despair by telling
me at the public offices that I might do my worst. I
have obeyed them: I have been watching more than
a fortnight for a favourable opportunity; I have done
my worst, and I rejoice in the deed!” He had no personal
enmity to Mr. Perceval, with whom, as it happened,
he had not at any time communicated; and he
would rather have had Lord Levison Gower for his
victim, who, having been ambassador in Russia, ought,
according to his opinion, to have interfered.</p>

<p>Bellingham was insane on the single point of his own
imagined injuries; but his insanity was of a kind which,
for the sake of society, must not be pleaded in bar of
justice before an earthly tribunal. The murder was committed
on a Monday, and as the sessions had commenced
at the Old Bailey, he was brought to trial on the
Friday, and executed on the Monday following. On
this occasion, it was seen to what a degree seditious
journalists, the most nefarious that ever were allowed to
make a free press their engine for mischief, had succeeded
in corrupting no small portion of the ignorant
and deluded multitude. When he was conveyed from
the House of Commons to Newgate, in a carriage

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conduct of the populace.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and under an escort, an attempt was made
to rescue him, and the soldiers were hooted.
The mob which collected next day in Palace-Yard
uttered the most atrocious exclamations. Before it was
known that Bellingham was an object of commiseration
as well as horror, he was extolled in pot-houses as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
friend to the people, who had done them good service in
killing a prime minister; exulting anticipations were
expressed that this was but the beginning, and that
more such examples would follow; healths were drunk
to those members of Parliament, whose language at
various times (whatever their intentions may have been)
had been mischievous enough to bring upon them the
stigma of such popularity: and in certain manufacturing
places public rejoicings were made for the murder
of a minister, who both in private and in public life was
absolutely without reproach. In public life he was without
fear also: this kingdom was never blest with a more
intrepid nor a more upright minister; he feared God,
and therefore he had no fear of man. There were persons
who upon his elevation alluded to the Knight of
the Round Table, from whom his family derive their descent,
and said that Sir Perceval was not the man who
could sit in the “Siege Perilous.” That seat, however,
he took, and filled it worthily; and like his ancestor in
the romance, he was qualified to do this by the purity
as well as by the strength of his character. A sense of
religious duty was the key-stone which crowned his virtues
and his talents, and kept them firm.</p>

<p>A grant of £50,000 for the twelve children of Mr.
Perceval was voted by Parliament, with a pension of
£2000 to his widow, and to the eldest son, whose reversion
was subsequently commuted for one of those
sinecures, against which, if they were always thus properly
bestowed, no voice would be raised. The loss of
the murdered minister was thus repaired to his family,
as far as it was reparable; but how was his place in the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Overtures from the ministry to M. Wellesley and Mr. Canning.<br /><span class="date">May 17.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

cabinet to be supplied? Overtures were made
to Mr. Canning and Marquis Wellesley, as persons
who were understood to act in unison, and
who in their views of foreign policy differed in
no respect from the existing ministers. They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
were informed that the Prince naturally looked to them,
because he was desirous of continuing his administration
upon its present basis, and also of strengthening it as
much as possible by associating to it such persons in
public life as agreed most nearly and generally in the
principles upon which public affairs had been conducted.
Lord Liverpool, by whom this communication was made,
stated that his colleagues wished him to be appointed
First Lord of the Treasury, and that their wish was known
to the Prince, when His Royal Highness charged him
with this negotiation; he added also, that Lord Castlereagh
was to retain his office, and act as leader in the
House of Commons.</p>

<p>It is probable that Mr. Canning was offended at this
latter intimation, though he manifested no such displeasure:
it is probable that he thought himself disparaged
when that part of the business of the House of
Commons for which he could not but be conscious that
he was pre-eminently qualified, was assigned to a person
who was in oratorical powers greatly his inferior. Marquis
Wellesley may also be supposed to have felt a kindred
disappointment; he could number few followers in
Parliament, but he had other friends, who for some time
had been endeavouring with more zeal and activity than
discretion, to persuade the nation that he was the only
statesman capable of conducting the government at a
crisis when the interests of all Europe were at stake.
But in this, though they appealed to his vigorous and
splendid administration in India, they altogether failed.
No doubt was entertained of his surpassing abilities, nor
of his comprehensive views, nor of the energy with which
he was capable of acting upon them. But that was
wanting on which the British people in the healthy and
natural state of public feeling were accustomed to rely;
he had to a certain degree their admiration, but not their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
confidence. And while his merits as an Indian governor
were understood by those only who were conversant
with Indian affairs, the villanous calumnies with which
he had been assailed for his conduct in that distant
country were more widely known, and were moreover
fresher in remembrance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>M. Wellesley’s reasons for declining them.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>He gained no ground in public opinion by his conduct
in the negotiation. The difference upon the Roman
Catholic question between himself and the cabinet
which he was invited to join, “was of the utmost
importance,” he said, “and would alone
compel him to decline the proposition.” But
that question, though in its consequences more
mischievous than any by which these kingdoms have
been agitated since the Restoration, was of no pressing
importance at that time, nor could all the arts and efforts
of those who promoted it induce the nation to think it
so. He asked also, whether all those persons designated
by the name of the opposition were to be excluded from
the proposed scheme of administration; “an inquiry
which,” he said, “originated in his sincere conviction
(founded upon an attentive observation of the general
state of public opinion, and of the condition of the empire)
that no administration which should not comprise
some of those persons, could prove advantageous to the
Prince Regent, conciliatory towards Ireland, and equal
to the conduct of the war, on a scale of sufficient extent.”
Marquis Wellesley must have been strangely deceived
when he supposed that public opinion supported him in
this notion: and it is even more remarkable that he
should have expected those persons to co-operate with
him in his vigorous plans for prosecuting the war, knowing
as he did, that from the beginning they had considered
it as hopeless, and had not less repeatedly than
confidently predicted its total failure. Farther, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
Marquis stated that the considerations which had induced
him to resign office had since acquired additional
force, and would constitute an insuperable obstacle to
his acceptance of any station in the present administration.
He had withdrawn from Mr. Perceval’s because
his general opinions on various important questions had
not sufficient weight in that cabinet to justify him towards
the public, or towards his own character in continuing
in office. “My objection,” said he, “to remaining
in that cabinet arose, in a great degree, from the imperfect
scale on which the efforts in the Peninsula were conducted.
It was always stated to me that it was impracticable
to enlarge that system. I thought it was perfectly
practicable; and that it was neither safe nor
honest towards this country or the allies to continue the
present inadequate scheme. Since my resignation it
has been found practicable to make some extension;
but it is still intimated, that my views are more extensive
than the resources of the country can enable the
government to reduce to practice. I, however, still entertain
the same views and opinions, without diminution
or alteration; and I am convinced that a considerable
extension of the scale of our operations in the Peninsula,
and also an effectual correction of many branches of our
system in that quarter, are objects of indispensable
necessity and of easy attainment. With such a decided
difference of opinion in relation to the conduct and
management of the war, my return into a cabinet composed
as the present is, would offer to me no better
prospect than the renewal of discussions which have
hitherto proved unavailing.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Canning’s.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mr. Canning rested his refusal of office solely upon
the Catholic question: “To accept it,” he said,
“would be to lend himself to the defeating of
his own declared opinions on that most important question;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
opinions which were as far as those of any man
from being favourable to precipitate an unqualified
concession. But by entering into the administration
while all consideration of that question was to be resisted,
I should incur,” said he, “such a loss of personal
and public character as would disappoint the object
which His Royal Highness the Prince Regent has at
heart, and must render my accession to his government
a new source of weakness rather than an addition of
strength.” Lord Liverpool had stated to Mr. Canning,
that Lord Castlereagh had from motives of delicacy
absented himself from the cabinet when the grounds on
which the overture was to be made were discussed; and
that he would be no obstacle in the way of arrangement.
This was consistent with the manliness and generosity
of Lord Castlereagh’s character, and it was received in
a corresponding spirit by Mr. Canning. “After the
expressions,” said he to Lord Liverpool, “with which
you were charged on the part of all your colleagues, I
should not be warranted in omitting to declare that no
objection of a personal sort should have prevented me
from uniting with any or all of them, if I could have
done so with honour.... I cannot deny myself the satisfaction
of adding, that the manner of your communication
with us has entirely corresponded with the habits and
sentiments of a friendship of so many years; a friendship
which our general concurrence on many great political
principles has strengthened, and which our occasional
differences have in no degree impaired.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>M. Wellesley’s statement.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>If the failure of this overture disappointed the hopes
which ministers had reasonably entertained of
strengthening themselves by the accession of
the two persons who were most in accord with
them upon all points of foreign policy, it had no tendency
to widen their differences; but just as it terminated,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
a statement of the causes which had induced
Marquess Wellesley to resign found its way into the
newspapers through the indiscretion of some of his
friends. It spoke in no measured terms of his late
colleagues: in his judgment, it was said, the cabinet
neither possessed ability and knowledge to devise a good
plan, nor temper and discernment to adopt what was
recommended to them: ... it said also that Marquis
Wellesley could not pay any deference to Mr. Perceval’s
judgment and attainments without injury to the public
service: that if his own opinions had been adopted, he
might have been willing to have served with him, but
would never have consented to serve under him in any
circumstances: that he had offered to act under Earl
Moira or Lord Holland, and made no exception to any
person as prime minister but Mr. Perceval, whom he
considered incompetent to fill that office, although
sufficiently qualified for inferior stations. The publication
of this statement would have been indiscreet at any
time; but being published a few days only after the
murder of Mr. Perceval, it excited a strong feeling of
displeasure. Just at this juncture, Mr. Stuart Wortley

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Stuart Wortley’s motion.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

moved in the House of Commons, that an
address should be presented to the Prince,
praying him to take measures for forming a
strong and efficient government. This ill-judged motion
was carried by a small majority; and the Prince in consequence
sent for Marquis Wellesley, and desired him
to form a plan of an administration. The Marquis
requested Mr. Canning, as the channel which might be

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 23.</span><br />M. Wellesley charged to form an administration.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

most agreeable to Lord Liverpool, to inquire
whether he and all or any of his colleagues
would form part of a ministry constituted upon
the principles of taking the Catholic question
into early consideration, with a view to its final<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
and satisfactory settlement, and of prosecuting the war
in the Peninsula with the best means of the country.
There was the strongest wish, it was added, to comprehend
in the arrangement, without any individual or
party exclusion whatever, as many as possible of such
persons as might be able to agree in giving their public
service to the country upon these two principles. With
regard to the distribution of offices nothing was stipulated;
every thing, therefore, was open to be arranged

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The ministers refuse to act with him.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to the honour and satisfaction of all parties. An
immediate answer was returned by Lord Liverpool,
for himself and his colleagues, saying,
that it was not necessary for them to enter into any
discussion of the two principles, because they all felt
themselves bound, particularly after what had recently
passed, to decline the proposal of becoming members
of an administration to be formed by Marquis Wellesley.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lords Grey and Grenville also decline.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Marquis Wellesley made a similar communication to
Lords Grey and Grenville, and through them to
their friends, observing, that he neither claimed
nor desired for himself any place in the new
arrangement, looking upon himself merely as the instrument
of executing the Prince’s commands in this
instance. Lords Grey and Grenville professed in reply,
that they felt it to be the duty of all public men at such
a moment; both by frank and conciliatory explanations
of principle, and by the total abandonment of every
personal object, to facilitate the means of giving effect
to the late vote of the House of Commons, and of averting
the imminent and unparalleled dangers of the country.
They cordially agreed with him upon the Catholic
question. As to the second point, “No person,” they
said, “feels more strongly than we do the advantages
which would result from a successful termination of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
present contest in Spain; but we are of opinion, that the
direction of military operations in an extensive war, and
the more or less vigorous prosecution of those operations,
are questions not of principle but of policy; to be regulated
by circumstances in their nature temporary and
fluctuating, and in many cases known only to persons in
official stations; by the engagements of the country, the
prospect of ultimate success, the extent of the exertions
necessary for its attainment, and the means of supporting
those efforts without too great a pressure on the finances
and internal prosperity of the country. On such questions,
therefore, no public men, either in or out of office,
can undertake for more than a deliberate and dispassionate
consideration, according to the circumstances
of the case as it may appear, and to such means of information
as may then be within their reach. But we cannot
in sincerity conceal from Marquis Wellesley, that in the
present state of the finances we entertain the strongest
doubts of the practicability of an increase in any branch
of the public expenditure.” Lords Lansdowne and
Holland concurred in this answer of the two opposition
leaders. Earl Moira’s reply was, “That a plan of
government on the basis proposed would have his most
cordial wishes; but that this declaration was not to
imply any engagement on his part to accept office.” In
the subsequent correspondence, Marquis Wellesley and
Mr. Canning said respecting the Catholic question, that
they did not conceive any farther parliamentary proceeding
to be necessary or practicable that session, than such
as might be sufficient to ensure, either by compulsion
upon a hostile administration, or by pledge from a
friendly one, the consideration of the question during
the recess, with a view to its being brought before
Parliament by the recommendation of the Crown early
in the ensuing session.” Earl Grey replied to this,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
“That he should very reluctantly abandon the hope of
passing a bill even during the present session for the
repeal of the disabilities whereof the Catholics complained;
but if this could not be done, he held it indispensable
that the most distinct and authentic pledge
should be given of the intention both of the executive
government and of Parliament to take the matter up as
one of the first measures of the next.” Touching the
conduct of the war, “It is impossible,” said he, “to
reduce a question of this nature to any fixed principle.
Whatever we can say with our present means of information
must necessarily be general and inconclusive. I
can have no hesitation in subscribing to the proposition,
that if it shall be found expedient to continue the exertions
we are now making in the Peninsula, they should
be conducted in the manner best calculated to answer
their end.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>M. Wellesley receives fuller powers.<br /><span class="date">June 1.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Here Marquis Wellesley’s commission ended: but the
ministers considered themselves as holding office
only till their successors should be appointed;
and in a few days the Marquis received full
authority to form an administration on the two
principles which he had laid down, and he was specially
instructed to communicate with Lords Grey and Grenville.
The Prince signified his pleasure that Marquis
Wellesley should conduct the formation of the administration
in all its branches, and should be first Commissioner
of the Treasury; and that Earl Moira, Lord
Erskine, and Mr. Canning should be members of the
cabinet. A cabinet formed on an enlarged basis must
be extended to the number of twelve or thirteen members;
and the Prince wished Lords Grey and Grenville
to recommend four persons if it consisted of twelve, five
if it should consist of thirteen; these persons to be
selected by the two lords without any exception or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
personal exclusion, and to be appointed by His Royal
Highness to such stations as might hereafter be arranged.
It was added, that entire liberty had been

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The two Lords persist in their reply.<br /><span class="date">June 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

granted to Marquis Wellesley to propose for the
Prince’s approbation the names of any persons
then occupying stations in His Royal Highness’s
councils, or of any other persons. In reply, the
two lords repeated their declaration, that no sense of the
public distress and difficulty, no personal feelings of
whatever description, would have prevented them from
accepting with dutiful submission any situations in
which they could have hoped to serve His Royal
Highness usefully and honourably; “But the present
proposal,” they said, “could not justify any such
expectation. We are invited,” they pursued, “not to
discuss with your lordship, or with any other public
men, according to the usual practice in such cases, the
various and important considerations, both of measures
and of arrangements, which belong to the formation of
a new government in all its branches; but to recommend
to His Royal Highness a number, limited by previous
stipulation, of persons willing to be included in a cabinet
of which the outlines are already definitively arranged.
To this proposal we could not accede without the
sacrifice of the very object which the House of Commons
has recommended, ... the formation of a strong
and efficient administration.... It is to the principle of
disunion and jealousy that we object; ... to the supposed
balance of contending interests in a cabinet so measured
out by preliminary stipulation. The times imperiously
require an administration united in principle and strong
in mutual reliance; possessing also the confidence of the
Crown, and assured of its support in those healing
measures which the public safety requires, and which
are necessary to secure to the government the opinion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
and affections of the people. No such hope is presented
to us by this project, which appears to us equally new
in practice and objectionable in principle. It tends, as
we think, to establish within the cabinet itself a system
of counteraction inconsistent with the prosecution of
any uniform and beneficial course of policy. We must
therefore request permission to decline all participation
in a government constituted upon such principles,
satisfied as we are that the certain loss of character which
must arise from it to ourselves could be productive only
of disunion and weakness in the administration of the
public interests.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Earl Moira’s letter to Earl Grey.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This called forth an explanatory letter to Earl Grey
from Earl Moira, who thought that the answer
of the two lords conveyed an oblique imputation
upon him, as a party involved in the procedure.
“You represent the proposition,” said he, “as
one calculated to found a cabinet upon a principle of
counteraction. When the most material of the public

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

objects which were to be the immediate ground
of that cabinet’s exertion had been previously
understood between the parties, I own it is difficult for
me to comprehend what principle of counteraction could
be introduced.... With regard to the indication of certain
individuals, I can assert, that it was a measure adopted
through the highest spirit of fairness to you and your
friends. Mr. Canning’s name was mentioned because
Marquis Wellesley would have declined office without
him, and it was a frankness to apprize you of it; and
Lord Erskine’s and mine were stated with a view of
showing, that Marquis Wellesley, so far from having
any jealousy to maintain a preponderance in the cabinet,
actually left a majority to those who had been
accustomed to concur upon most public questions; and
he specified Lord Erskine and myself, that you might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
see the number submitted for your exclusive nomination
was not narrowed by the necessity of advertence to
us. The choice of an additional member of the cabinet
left to you must prove how undistinguishable we
consider our interests and yours, when this was referred
to your consideration as a mere matter of convenience,
the embarrassment of a numerous cabinet being well
known. The reference to members of the late cabinet,
or other persons, was always to be coupled with the
established point, that they were such as could concur
in the principles laid down as the foundation for the
projected ministry; and the statement was principally
dictated by the wish to show that no system of exclusion
could interfere with the arrangements which the public
service might demand. On the selection of those persons,
I aver, the opinions of you, Lord Grenville, and the
others whom you might bring forward as members of
the cabinet, were to operate as fully as our own; and
this was to be the case also with regard to subordinate
offices. The expression that this was left to be proposed
by Marquis Wellesley was intended to prove that His
Royal Highness did not, even in the most indirect
manner, suggest any one of those individuals. It is
really impossible that the spirit of fairness can have
been carried further than has been the intention in this
negotiation. I therefore lament most deeply that an
arrangement, so important for the interests of the country,
should go off upon points which I cannot but think
wide of the substance of the case.”</p>

<p>This frank and manly remonstrance produced no effect
upon the determination of the two lords. The objections
stated in their joint letter “could not,” they said, “be

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

altered by a private explanation, which, though
it might lessen some obvious objections to a
part of the detail, still left the general character of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
proceeding unchanged. They were, however, happy to
receive it as an expression of personal regard, and of that
desire which they readily acknowledged in Lord Wellesley
and Moira, and which was reciprocal on their
own part, that no difference of opinion on the matter in
question should produce on either side any personal
impression which might obstruct the renewal of a conciliatory
intercourse whenever a more favourable opportunity

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>M. Wellesley resigns his commission.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

shall be afforded for it.” Marquis Wellesley
then thought it indispensably necessary
for his public and private honour to declare in
parliament that he had resigned the commission with
which the Prince had charged him. Something he lost
in public opinion through the indiscretion of his friends,
which had rendered it impossible for his former colleagues
ever again cordially to unite with him; something
on the other hand he gained by the unavoidable
comparison which was drawn between the fair and
explicit straight-forwardness of his overtures to the two
lords, and the captious manner in which they had been
received.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Negotiation with Earl Moira.<br /><span class="date">June 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Earl Moira now, after conferring with the Duke of
Bedford, addressed a note to the two lords.
“Venturing, as being honoured,” he said, “with
the Prince Regent’s confidence to indulge his
anxiety that an arrangement of the utmost importance to
the country should not go off on any misunderstanding,
he entreated them to advert to his explanatory letter,
and desired an interview with them, if they thought the
disposition expressed in that letter were likely to lead to
any co-operation. Should the issue of the interview be
according to his hope, he would then solicit the Prince’s
permission to address them formally: the present mode
he had adopted for the sake of precluding all difficulties
in the outset.” The two lords replied, “That they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
highly gratified by the kindness of the motive on which
Earl Moira acted; that personal communication with
him would always be acceptable and honourable to
them, but they hoped he would be sensible that no
advantage was likely to result from pursuing this subject
by unauthorized discussion, and in a course different
from the usual practice. Motives of obvious delicacy,”
they said, “must prevent their taking any step toward
determining the Prince to authorize Earl Moira to address
them personally. They should always receive
with dutiful submission His Royal Highness’s commands,
in whatever manner and through whatever channel
he might be pleased to signify them; but they could
not venture to suggest to His Royal Highness, through
any other person, their opinions on points on which
His Royal Highness was not pleased to require their
advice.”</p>

<p>Earl Moira reported this to the Prince, and being then
provided with the required formalities, he renewed his
overture, but with diminished hope. “Discouraged,”
he said, “as he must be, he could not reconcile it to
himself to leave any effort untried, and he had therefore
adopted the principle of the two lords for an interview,
though doubting whether the desired conclusion could be
so well advanced by it as by the mode which he had
suggested. He had now the Prince’s instructions to
take steps for the formation of a ministry, and was
specially authorized to address himself to Lords Grey
and Grenville, with whom, therefore, in company with
Lord Erskine, he requested an interview.” It was one
characteristic of these remarkable negotiations, that whatever
passed in conversation between the parties was
minuted, and that publicity was given to those minutes
and to all the notes which were interchanged ... a mode
of proceeding neither prudent in itself nor as a precedent.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
At this meeting, what Earl Moira considered the preliminary
points were satisfactorily disposed of; the two
lords, it was declared, might pursue their own course of
policy both with regard to Ireland and to the United
States of America, and the majority which they were to
have in the cabinet assured them the same preponderance
upon other questions. There was, however, another
preliminary which appeared to them of great importance,
and which they thought it necessary to bring
forward immediately, lest farther inconvenient and embarrassing
delay might be produced, if this negotiation
should be broken off in a more advanced state: no restriction
was laid on their considering any points which
they might deem useful for the Prince’s service; they
asked, therefore, whether this full liberty extended to
the consideration of new appointments to those great
offices of the household which have usually been included
in the political arrangements made on a change of administration;
and they intimated their opinion, that it
would be necessary to act on the same principle now.
Earl Moira answered, “that the Prince had laid no
restriction upon him in that respect, and had never
pointed in the most distant manner at the protection of
those officers from removal” but he added, “that it
would be impossible for him to concur in making the
exercise of this power positive and indispensable in the
formation of the administration, because he should deem
it on public grounds peculiarly objectionable.” To this
Lords Grey and Grenville replied, “That they also acted
on public grounds alone, and with no other feeling whatever
than that which arose from the necessity of giving
to a new government that character of efficiency and stability,
and those marks of the constitutional support of the
Crown, which were required for enabling it to act usefully
for the public service; and that on these grounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
it appeared indispensable that the connexion of the
great offices of the court with the political administration
should be clearly established in its first arrangement.”
This decided difference having been thus expressed on
both sides, the conversation ended here, with mutual
declarations of regret: and here also, to the great satisfaction
of the public, ended all negotiations with the two
leaders of Opposition, at the very time when, but for
their own marvellous mismanagement, the government
would have been delivered into their hands.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The old ministry is re-established.<br /><span class="date">June 8.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the second day after this decisive interview, Lord
Liverpool informed the House of Lords that the
Prince had been pleased to appoint him first
Commissioner of the Treasury, and had authorized
him to complete the other arrangements of
the administration. This led to a conversation, in which
Earl Moira stated what his views had been in these transactions
... and declared his determination to support the
ministry, so far as they might act consistently with the
principles which had guided his political life. He had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>M. Wellesley’s explanation.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

called upon Marquis Wellesley to explain what
he meant by asserting that dreadful personal
animosities had manifested themselves in the
course of the negotiation. The Marquis replied, “That
he had used the words advisedly; and no better proof
of the charge could be required than the language of
Lords Liverpool and Melville, one of whom had expressly
declined to be a member of any administration formed by
him, and the other had stated his objection as a matter
of personal feeling.” Lord Harrowby made answer to
this: ... “On the very day,” he said, “on which Mr.
Stuart Wortley’s motion was carried, he and his friends
had agreed to form part of an administration of which
Marquis Wellesley was to have had the lead; but subsequent
circumstances had made them alter that determination.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
The statement in which the Marquis accused
his late colleagues of incapacity to conduct the government
had wounded them through the memory of him
who had just fallen by the hand of an assassin, whom
they had considered as the life and soul of their cabinet,
and whom they in the highest degree respected and esteemed;
... a man of unimpeachable integrity, who never
wanted defence in the eyes of those who knew his value.
That statement had produced feelings in himself and his
friends which rendered it impossible for them cordially
to unite with the Marquis in any administration.
Marquis Wellesley replied, “That what had been just
said confirmed the truth of his assertion, but he acquitted
himself of any part in the publication of the statement.
As soon as his resignation was known, some of his
friends,” he said, “took down in writing his account of
it in the expressions which fell from him in the heat of
conversation: though they had often been solicited to
publish this, they had uniformly refused, and he himself
was horror-struck when he saw it in the public newspapers:
for the statement,” he said, “was not his; it
contained expressions which he would not have used in
a document intended for the public eye, more especially
at a moment when the country had just lost a man of the
most irreproachable character, of the most perfect integrity,
of the mildest heart, of the most amiable qualities,
having, indeed, been distinguished by every private
virtue. But it was no reproach to any man to be thought
unfit for the supreme direction of government; and
though he looked upon the act which deprived Mr.
Perceval of his life as a stain on humanity, he never
considered him, when living, as a fit person to lead the
councils of this great empire. He admitted that he had
never formally dissented in the cabinet from the opinions
of his colleagues, though he had frequently put them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
in full possession of his own: he declared also, that
there were many of their measures which he highly
approved, and that he would give them his cordial support,
as far as that could be done consistently with the
deliberate opinion which he had formed on the great
points of national policy: but he concluded by repeating,
that they had opposed obstacles to the establishment
of an efficient administration, and that those obstacles
originated in personal feelings.”</p>

<p>There was no tendency in this speech to conciliate,
but it was not likely farther to displease those whom
Marquis Wellesley had already wounded, nor to wound

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Earl Grey.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

others. Earl Grey then rose to make his explanation
and his charges. “For himself,” he said,
“no man could be more anxious than he was, even as
far as was consistent with his honour, to outstretch a
feeble but a ready hand to save a sinking nation. But
a strong suspicion had operated on his mind throughout
the recent negotiations, that he and his friends were
either not to be admitted into the cabinet at all, or, if
admitted, to be bound down in such a manner that the
public should be secured against the influence of the
principles and measures to which, during their whole
parliamentary existence, they had been pledged.” Alluding
then to Marquis Wellesley and Earl Moira, he
said, “that though in his late intercourse with them he
could discover nothing but an unceasing and earnest
desire to conciliate, and a laudable anxiety for the general
good, he nevertheless suspected that they themselves
had been deceived, and were not aware of the secret
management of which they had been made the instrument.”

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Earl Moira’s reply.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Earl Moira replied with becoming
warmth to the imputation, solemnly declaring,
“that he had undertaken the negotiation without a
single particle of reservation in the authority with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
which he was intrusted; that he had stated to Lords
Grey and Grenville, beyond the possibility of misapprehension,
that his instructions were of the most liberal
and unlimited nature, and that the transaction from
beginning to end had been conducted with a severity of
fairness, if he might use the expression, which was perfectly
unparalleled. I claim,” said he, “of the noble
Earl a statement of the particular circumstances to
which he alludes, that I may repel the assertion in as
haughty a tone as he has ventured to make it. My
lords, I feel that I have not deserved this reproach: it
is a disgrace which I do not merit, and which I cannot
bear. If he can bring forward but the shadow of a
proof that even unknowingly I submitted to be made
such an instrument, I shall bow my head to his reproof,
and to the degradation which must ensue. If he cannot,
I shall repel the imputation as proudly as it was made.
There was never in the most insignificant point the
slightest reservation or hint of reservation: the powers
given to me were complete and ample; and whenever
limited, they were limited only by me from a sense of
what was due to the public. I now call upon the noble
Earl more satisfactorily to explain his meaning.” But
Earl Grey contented himself with hinting that he might
find some future opportunity for a more distinct explanation;
and he let it appear that he himself was the person
to whom the authority for forming an administration
ought, in his opinion, to have been intrusted. Lord
Grenville, with more judgment, avoided all offensive
topics in his speech; the points which Earl Grey and
he had refused to concede were, he averred, of material
and fundamental importance, and they never would consent
to become members of a ministry founded on a
principle which, in their deliberate opinion, was calculated
to overthrow the practice of the constitution.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Stuart Wortley’s second motion.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But it was in the House of Commons that it was made
known with what hasty imprudence the two lords had
broken off their negotiation with Earl Moira. Mr.
Stuart Wortley, who ought to have learned
from the result of his former motion how bootless
the repetition of such an experiment must
prove, moved for a second address to the Prince, regretting
that the first had not led to its expected consequences,
and expressing the anxiety of the House that
the arrangements for establishing an efficient administration
should speedily be brought to a close. But the
House was not disposed a second time to entertain such
a motion. The temper in which Earl Moira’s overtures
had been rejected drew forth severe comments in the
course of the debate; and a statement which

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Yarmouth’s statement.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Lord Yarmouth made on the part of the household
produced a strong impression both in and
out of Parliament. “With respect to the household,”
he said for himself and his friends, “that it was their
intention to resign their situations before the new administration
should enter upon office. This intention,” he
affirmed, “was well known: they had taken every
means of stating it in quarters whence it was likely to
reach the interested parties, and in particular they had
communicated it to one who took an active part in the
negotiation, and with whom all who knew him confessed
it was a happiness to spend their private hours.” Mr.
Sheridan, who was the person intended, confirmed this
statement. “They took every means short of resignation,”
Lord Yarmouth continued, “to show that they never
wished to have any connexion with the noble lords; and
their intention originated in a wish to save the Prince
from the humiliation which he must have experienced at
seeing them turned out of office, ... a humiliation which
could only serve to convey an unfavourable impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
against the government throughout the country. He
did not speak in the name of one or two, but of all the
officers of the household: they stated expressly to his
Royal Highness that they wished to resign, and not to
be turned out; and all they requested was, that they
might know ten minutes before certain gentlemen received
the seals that such a circumstance was to take
place: before God he declared that this had been their
intention, and that the only principle by which they
were actuated was to save the Prince from humiliation;
for they could not but consider the attempt at making
this change in the household a preliminary to entering
upon the negotiation as calculated to humiliate his
Royal Highness in the eyes of the country.”</p>

<p>The party who were in opposition seemed to think it
preposterous that the existing ministers should presume
to hold their offices. “It was monstrous,” Lord Milton
said, “to see men who were held up repeatedly to scorn
and ridicule brave public opinion and return into power!”

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lord Castlereagh’s speech.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Lord Castlereagh defended himself and his colleagues
with considerable address, and ably performed
the not very difficult task of contrasting
their conduct with that of their assailants. “The proposed
address,” he said, “contained no expressions to
which he could hesitate in becoming a party, neither
should he to the further expression of a hope that the
Prince would avail himself of any opportunity for
strengthening the present administration: ... but such
an address was uncalled for by any message from the
Crown: it could lead to no practical result; its obvious
import was to insinuate that the administration was not
likely to possess the confidence of the country; and this
insinuation was founded upon its structure, not upon its
conduct: he could not then think it possible that the
House would sanction it for no other purpose but to disqualify<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
the government from the arduous task in which
it was engaged. The late transactions would induce the
House not again to push the principle which they had
so strongly asserted. A proceeding so sudden was not
to be found in English history as that which they had
lately seen, when the House decided, not against a ministry
who had proved themselves unworthy of confidence,
but against an administration the formation of which
was but in progress. This precedent he hoped future
Parliaments would never follow; for those must be blind
who could not see the calamitous consequences which
the occurrences of the last three weeks were calculated
to produce on our foreign and domestic relations. Three
or four distinct negotiations had failed, and the Crown
was obliged to call on the present cabinet to charge
itself with the affairs of the country. It was his consolation
to think, that while on the one hand he and his
colleagues had never stood between the Crown and the
people, so on the other hand they had never shown a
disposition to shrink from the discharge of public duties,
deterred as they otherwise might be by the accumulated
difficulties which the late transactions had occasioned.
For he could not help thinking that the course which
had been pursued was most injurious, and might be
fatal to the interests of the public. Never in former
times had a negotiation between public men been exhibited
to the eyes of Parliament and the country at
large, and exposed to all the invidious comments which
the malignity and the ignorance of mankind might pass
upon them. For his part, he could never augur well of any
negotiation in which two men could not approach each
other in a private room, although on public principles,
without coming armed with pen and ink, and prepared
to let every thing they might utter go forth immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
for the judgment of the public! The consequences in
this instance would, he trusted, have the effect of preventing
the recurrence of such scenes for the time to
come.... It was a painful task for him to speak of the
overtures from Marquis Wellesley, though he disclaimed
any thing like personal animosity to him. The paper
which had appeared he understood to have been published
without the noble Marquis’s consent; but after
such a statement had appeared, describing as it had
described Mr. Perceval and those who acted with him,
he appealed to the House whether gentlemen situated as
his colleagues were could without degradation meet such
an overture in any other way than that in which it had
been met? He entertained the sincerest respect for
Marquis Wellesley, with the highest admiration for his
accomplishments and his talents; and those feelings
were heightened by the consideration that he was the
brother of the greatest soldier this country had produced.
For him, therefore, it was peculiarly painful to be called
on to decide on such an occasion; but when one answer
only could be given by his colleagues, thinking as he
did, though not included in it, that the description which
had been given of them was unjust, he must have abandoned
every sense of duty if he had not been anxious to
repel the charge.” Having then touched upon Earl
Moira’s negotiation with the two lords, and observed
that the question concerning the household had been
taken up in a tone which the country would never countenance
in those who approached the throne, he concluded
thus: ... “And now all I have to say for ministers
is, that they claim the constitutional support of Parliament
till their actions seem to speak them unworthy of
it; and though the present government may not possess
within itself all those attributes which we have heard given<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
to broad and extended administrations, they have at least
one recommendation to public confidence (and it is not a
small one), that they have no disunion among themselves.
We have no private ends to answer; we are anxious
to serve our country, to do our best, and to submit our
conduct to the judgment of Parliament.”</p>

<p>With these remarkable circumstances was that ministry
formed, under whose administration the French were
beaten out of Spain, and Buonaparte’s empire overthrown.
For the second time since the commencement
of the war it had rested with the leaders of opposition
whether or not they should take the government into
their own hands; and for the second time, by an overweening
opinion of their own importance, and a most
undue depreciation of those whom they expected to displace,
they disappointed their own hopes, and in an
equal degree the apprehensions of the nation. The sound
part of the public, and they were a large majority, regarded
the result with as much satisfaction as they had
felt upon the recapture of Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz;
they looked upon it as tantamount to a great victory
over the enemy, and the enemy would indeed have
seen in a contrary result the surest presage of their own
success; for what more could the French ministers desire
than that the British government should be conducted
by men who from the beginning of the war in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Spain up to this crisis had pronounced their
own cause to be hopeless? That danger was no longer
to be feared; and although the cabinet had lost its
ablest member in Mr. Perceval ... the only member who
united in himself powerful ability with sound judgment,
and strength of character with strength of principle, and
who commanded in an equal degree the respect of his
opponents and the confidence of his friends, the opposition
had lost more in the exposure of their temper and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
the total frustration of their hopes, which was as much
the proper as the necessary consequence.</p>

<p>The only unfortunate circumstance in these transactions
was, that Marquis Wellesley should have been excluded,
or rather should have excluded himself, from a
place in the ministry: whatever his own expectations
might have been, his friends had expected to see him at
its head; and had Lord Wellington been supplied with
such reinforcements as in that event might have been
looked for, it was believed in the army that in the
course of the year he would have driven the French out
of Spain. The Spanish Government was at this time

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pecuniary assistance to the Spaniards.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

little satisfied with Great Britain, because greater pecuniary
assistance was not afforded them from
resources which they supposed to be infinite.
It was indeed the opinion of those whose opportunities
of information enabled them to form a just
opinion upon the subject, that the Spaniards could make
no efficient exertion unless they were aided with two
millions a year in money and one in provisions, which
might be procured at Cadiz from America and from the
Mediterranean by bills on England: but the British
Government consented only to give 600,000<i>l.</i> in the
course of the current year, with arms and clothing for
100,000 men; at length it agreed that the money
should be one million. The Spaniards did not remember
with how little wisdom and effect the large supplies
which they had hitherto received had been expended;
and in England sufficient allowance was not
made for the peculiar difficulties in which Spain was
placed: and while the errors of its successive governments
were strongly perceived, sufficient credit was
not given for the national spirit which had displayed
itself with such unexampled and invincible endurance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Proposal concerning Spanish troops.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Some persons there were who were of opinion that
no sure progress could be made towards the
deliverance of Spain, unless a Spanish army
were created on whose operations Lord Wellington
could calculate and rely. But the opinion was
abandoned upon farther knowledge of the Spaniards:
the officers, with some rare and noble exceptions, were
too ignorant, too idle, too prejudiced, and too proud, to
receive instruction from their allies; and British officers
could not be introduced in any useful number, for this
would have offended the national pride. It was suggested
by Mr. Tupper, who in his station as consul at
Valencia had acted with great zeal and ability in the
common cause, that the foreign regiments in the Spanish
service might be taken into English pay, and officered
by British officers. They still retained their
foreign names, and were under foreign officers, but were
chiefly composed of Spanish recruits: this, therefore, he
argued, might be done without wounding the pride of
the Spaniards, offending their prejudices, or injuring
the interests of any class of men; whereas to place the
Spanish army under the same subordination as the
Portugueze, though the people, and especially the soldiers
themselves, might like it, must be impossible, so
great would be the opposition of the officers and of all
the higher classes. This suggestion, for whatever reason,
was either not entertained, or not found practicable;
and the only arrangement made at this time was, that
the Spaniards allowed 5000 men to be enlisted and
incorporated with the allies. Some hope, however, was
entertained from a diversion to be made on the eastern
coast by a British force from Sicily in conjunction with

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Plan of a diversion from Sicily.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

a Spanish division, which by General Whittingham’s
recommendation had been formed in
Majorca, and trained there under his directions.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
This force it was thought, if its operations were well
planned and vigorously pursued, might compel the
French to withdraw from the southward; and engaged
as it was now evident that Buonaparte would be in his
Russian war, the deliverance of Spain might be hoped
for as now not long to be delayed.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> There was a town called Bedouin
in the department of Vaucluse,
which contained about 500
houses and some 2000 inhabitants:
they had a good trade in silk, and
the place was flourishing. In the
month of May, 1794, the tree of liberty
which had been planted without
this town was cut down during
the night. Fearing in those dreadful
times the consequence of this act of
individual indiscretion, the townsmen
themselves informed the deputy Maignet
of it, an ex-priest, who was then
upon a Robespierrean mission in the
department. This availed nothing
in their favour: he issued a decree
proscribing not only the people of
Bedouin, but of the surrounding communes
also, and condemned the town
to be burnt. An officer, by name
Suchet, commanded the battalion
which accompanied Maignet’s commission
to execute this decree. Sixty
fathers of families, after the mockery
of a revolutionary trial, were put to
death, those who were spared being
placed at the foot of the scaffold
during the execution. Suchet then
gave the word for setting fire to the
town, and it was burnt to the ground.
The church was the only building
which was not destroyed by the
flames, and that was demolished by
means of gunpowder. Such of the
inhabitants as had fled were hunted
out in their retreats by the soldiers
of the detachment, and shot like wild
beasts. The answer of Robespierre’s
Committee of Public Safety to the
report of this transaction was, <i>Le
Comité est satisfaite de la conduite
de Maignet</i>.

the format in which you are reading this eBook, Sidenotes may be
distinguished from regular text by being shown in some combination
of italics, boldface, UPPER-CASE, enclosed in ♦DIAMOND SYMBOLS♦,
being offset into the left-margin, or in a rectangular area within
the regular text. Due to limitations of some eReaders, some sidenotes
may appear next to or below each other, depending on the width of the
screen.</p>

<p>The original Table of Contents used “ib.” when the page number was the
same as the one in the previous entry. This eBook uses the actual page
numbers.</p>

<p>The years in which events occurred were printed in the running heads.
In this eBook, the first occurrence of each new year has been added
to the Sidenotes by the Transcriber. Sidenote dates also have been
added at the beginning of each chapter. This does not form an unbroken
timeline, as the years in the running heads sometimes went back and
forth.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_254">254</a>: “E’tat-major” appears to have been printed that way; should
be “État-major”.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
